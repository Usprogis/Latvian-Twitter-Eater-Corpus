@ElitaKazaine @tvitermaniaks @atheist_from_lv must look somewhere at Popokatepetl’s for some Tomato Words, won't be in parents dowry :( and some ritual for the Hungry Dates of the Big Bunch
@maljorka Hehe, I prefer without nothing then, not like this. :D Ah, tastes are so different.
@IngaStirna Apple charlotte.
We were at Grandma’s today (firewood + things to bring). I expected that it would get better, and I would miss her less, but we could only talk through the window and we ate buns in the car instead of having lunch. Not ok.
@DigiPapucis @LLauliba To be really honest around 50% of the time I feel like that guy from @LLauliba. E.g. “Oh, the horror, kids have smeared something because he didn't look”, “The kids were eating flakes for breakfast” is my everyday now. And overall, everything is fine. Slightly annoyed by the norms how every parent should behave, especially NOW
@E_Stendzenieks “So have you eaten or not? If you have not eaten, what should I make for you, put your ass on the floor"
Mushrooms can also be picked in the spring and coppice, and they are not poisonous if you know how to cook, we have eaten them since childhood! https://t.co/heGv5LVR7W
Attention! Important news in my life 1. I am finally eating cold soup 2. The cold soup was blue https://t.co/CijIXDZKuy
@INiedzviedze @WilmaLinda Honestly, I liked school lunch very much. My mother was offended when I praised her that the meatball was as tasty as it is at school. 
@WilmaLinda In my childhood, one aunt showed a recipe - mix margarine with grated cheese and tomato sauce, smear on white bread, a fresh cucumber on top. Jesus, even now I started drooling. And I will never understand any fried fish and the phenomenon of fish or milk soups.
@Uckevics @maljorka It's about that one can nibble a carrot, eat an apple or a tomato. But adding simply chopped vegetables without an additive isn't tasteful. Besides, vegetables without additives are not salads. In winter, pile up sliced Chinese cabbage and a couple of slices of tomato. What is this?
@MrBalins @WilmaLinda celery with chocolate and @shmaramagda
@RaivisDejus @edaliba Not eating meat is a very irrational act because you're forced to eat physically larger volumes, resulting in more of your precious life wasted in in such a pointless thing as eating.
@WilmaLinda I very much like dressed herring, just without herring.
@WilmaLinda Milk vegetable soup when the new potatoes and other vegetables appear.
@WilmaLinda Sorrel soup is my favorite soup! But in general, quite normal dishes are listed in these comments. :) I don't know what strange things I eat - do raw, freshly peeled potatoes count? Very tasty :) Oh, and I also like all offal, starting with liver and ending with the bull's testicles :D
I know it's stylish to say that when you eat a fish or a chicken, you're practicing some kind of vegetarianism, but you're not a idiot, and stop it. You're disturbing people who don't eat meat very much, because due to you omnivores think that a vegetarian = eating only a few types of meat/a picky eater.
@DGFelton @sencis_ @Vinkele Of course. If Ramona would be there, the defenders of Ilze would eat him off with all of his clothes. That's exactly why it amuses me.
@IvarsNeiders By the way that impossible burger and beyond meat - a really interesting product. There is one third company in Latvia only, but even they are already very delicious. I recommend to try OLearys in the Akropole, they have such a burger. Made of plants, but tastes super
@mairitagurova The taxi driver was introduced through acquaintances of acquaintances. We walked everything on foot. We got tired. Then he got us cakes and burgers. We protested, of course, but he told us that Valmiera residents are hospitable folk. Your tour reminded me of how lovely it is on that side.
@selmuushh Everything normal, I like a cheese sandwich with caramel sauce, I don't regret anything.
@sankuperis Well, at least is is allowed to remove the mask while eating

In the USA, GABA can be purchased as a food supplement without rx. I bought 200caps at Walmart for 7$. I eat one, interesting feeling, because after 15 minutes there is an abnormal sour taste in my mouth. I remembered acid stimulation and pharmacology. Anxiety was induced more than suppressed. Bottle in the trash can, bye.
People like to live in Latvia because there is nature, family, friends, but you must also eat and earn: @ssemjonovs @RIGATV24 #presesklubs
coffee and cigarette best breakfast and u cant tell me otherwise
@elinakursite Make spaghetti with minced meat. Over time, I have perfected the recipe, and now I make the Bologna sauce in my own way. But it's still one of my favorite dishes. :)
@taecooknina Chocolate cake/tart 
@TInzenieris you just don't know how to. and actually, in Soviet times the sausage was made from real meat and everyone had a place to live :D
The hardest thing at work are the last 7 hours. Drank coffee already, sit, wait when it will be ok to go home.
@selmuushh Eating pancakes with cheese and strawberry or raspberry jam. The best composition! It's not normal, so I’m told.
@vaivarei @IvetaKazoka The person who is doing this right now was convincingly crossed out even of those few who voted for the Health Minister's Party, but now decides what and how to do...So- you rather not bother yourself with thinking!  Better to guzzle some schnapps and eat meatballs than philosophize about health.
@krisselerts @davissuneps My last big shock of beer prices was when Kinfield (RIP, of course) Valmiermuiža in a bottle went for 5 EUR. Which might be OK in an upscale place, but the food there cost 6-7. 
There was a scandal in the morning with “I can't stand it anymore, I'm going to kindergarten” (oh, I recognize myself). We already played cafe for lunch, and the five-year-old is making lunch. The melted cheese triangle in the middle of the pizza is a #zerowaste decor, because “no one will eat one, I'll decorate it here”. https://t.co/TAztzutnDF
@alise_bi Yeah, shouldn't have - the survey was set up tendentious, with a hint. The results already show that the number of top and bottom cheeseputters is the same, but finding the real reason for choosing the constructive scheme is not possible. Just as good “helps contain”, how it tastes better or looks lovely.

@DvinuMamma How lucky I was at the moment my child learned to breastfeed (1.5months). I enjoyed feeding with the bottle and then breast + milking. In principle, all you do is feed or milk and wash all the gadgets. Hallelujah it is over.
@MatissJekabsons It would be ok if you exported the goods or you had an online shop. Then perhaps bilingualism should have been introduced? Who knows maybe somebody will mix cream with milk.
@realGints @Tas_es_Pats @skatsnokoka Ticks. One got in my ear and bit it. Yesterday I just read about flavivirus. But at least there are no (for now) South-specific mosquitoes with the viruses they carry. (Off-topic)
Anyone knows any of the Bolderāja manufacturer's “Buschman (or something similar) Tools”? They work with the metal, for export. And here, like nourishment, we need one of their manufactured tools...
@labina2kurpes Hobo or a piece of meat - that's still a question.
@zaledaja Grow back your hair, they said. Eat your hair like spices with each dish, they said.
@rubinstein_ And actually - “the most wonderful time of the year” is about time when you can eat cold soup again. Long live the jar pickled beetroot!
@ELisovskis The thoughts of being OK differ from customs in each family individually. In one it is eaten with pleasure, in another it’s rejected, because “I don't eat it.” I think that when feeling a real sense of hunger I would eat it without any objection.
@IneseEjugbo @HenrietaVerho Done. Such a tasty subject for my brother. Cheers!
@and_kse @selmuushh I think the mistake is in the strawberry jam. Russian with raspberry jam *is* yummy
PINK MOUNTAINS When the mother of the earth boiled pink semolina, she was waiting for the father of the sky in her house. This mother's lunch was so tasty that father took it with him to heaven. And all the clouds that ate the semolina turned into miraculous pink hills. https://t.co/P9Mgi79TRY

@Eriks_the_Great There's that fancy word- filling. :) The food is good, the hosts great, but that view of the lake is not interchangeable with anything. There were a lot of cars today, people are not rushing away, going for walks, everybody has enough space. The hostess is exhausted.:)
@svartkvit @Dzherijs Would you entrust him to pick mushrooms? :)
@VinetaPu Stew - fry onions in a pot, pour in potatoes and pour over a glass of broth. Add tomatoes in their own juice and Turkish peas. Add some broccoli, mushrooms, squash, or whatever your heart desires.
@ritaignate @ArvisKolmanis There are breads where there is no added sugar or malt - you certainly have to have some there. And a quick bread can baked at home too. I didn't use any added sugar for half a year, I thought it easy, just have to think along.
on the beach a company of five married-age young people wanted to take a picture in the hammock where I was sitting with children. I offered to lick the spoon with which we ate lunch too. they became offended and said I was in violation of all the rules.

@jabuslemts I get gastritis in the period when I eat healthier than ever. But the culprit is stress and the muscle that doesn't close the stomach completely and the acid goes in the gullet + you can't lie down or bend over after eating, the same.
where are the meat tenderizers in the shop? I can't find any, but I want pork chops.
Someone on the bus is eating a banana. He probably doesn't know how awful the smell is.

@NeilaKrave @karlis_arajs I don't believe that you haven’t met a vegetarian at a party who, instead of quietly eating bread with cheese, salads, dessert, starts to read a lecture on animal rights. Another thing that happened is that in a communal kitchen with one refrigerator vegetarians have objections that others keep products there too.
And what did you do today? I ate a sweet cheese dessert with a three day old expiration date.
It's a very, very, very bad day today. I didn't sleep at all during the night, and in the day I was shivering and crying the whole time. My eyes are hurting. Sleep is important. Food is important. Fluid is important. Movements in fresh air are important. All of this affects mental health.

Diploma thesis: I hate it that Hesburer™️ raises prices and does not train employees, and that is why there is shitty service, errors in order execution, and in overall the new shape of the potatoes is shit and oil everywhere (EVERYWHERE) tastes like a week old.

I bought a bun, and I thought I'd eat it on the bus - I didn't have breakfast today. I waited for the bus, put on a mask, pulled out the bun, broke my own brain.

@btsjams321 but at least coffee is always with me and never fails when I do my homework at three o'clock at night
@kkriistaaaaa coffee gives black circles under your eyes and caffeine addiction
@btsjams321 yes, but coffee is the best
@liana_langa @ZiemasEzis @AnitaDreika @XforY Sure everyone is translating differently. My version is that there is a mix up at the very beginning when Baiba bites to realise that it's not Zane and falls in love at first sight! And of course it was a big spite that the first guy in the village didn't get the girl he wanted.
@bemusha Ye tasty, and I mostly don’t screw it up, following instructions and the complexity very much suits me :) Only there were minuscule moments - I had to many strawberries and they were too large, It'd look visually better with smaller or sliced ones. Next time ^^
@_evija And some dishes taste better if you eat them with your fingers.
Happy birthday to Rihards Gorkša. The multitasker who fries meat on hashtags and reads instastorias to daughters. Cheers!
Cehist, blissed at his successful tweet in his opinion, polished his leather shoes and Lenin's badge, tied the red scarf around his fat neck from eating sunflower-seeds and pastries, and walks out on the sidewalk to spit thinly.
Sometimes I'm so annoyed by my virtue of not being able to eat the last bite of food because I don't want to/doesn’t fit. There's a little left, but that’s it, no way! So thank you to all my watch pigs.
I'm sitting in a cardboard box right now and eating grapes
@koszmarek_LV it was 20 years ago, then countrymen haven't gone through the bitter school of life yet. Children of people screaming then are currently picking Irish mushrooms.
@LusisToms @GMeluskans @Palkavnieks Depends also on the brine and soup, beetroot - water based soup doesn't work with sausage, in white kephir soup it fits very well, also in the red beetroot brine it doesn't fit while in the white it is very ok.
@hmm_pff @Oysterreich Really. with the eyes of a spirit I see this Russian in his future life dressing in a linen shirt braiding swastika decorated badges eating cumin cheese and making puzours. take that Russian - one to zero in favor of nationalism!
I'm not saying anything, but I've been waiting for such breakfast. Self smoked meat and all greens, fresh from my own garden 
About face masks- we have to grind the floors too. Are they anywhere now, or do we really have to eat dust from paint?
@VilksTavsBiedrs It applies to farmhouses. My relative, in the name of old love, ran to the love of his youth. There you had it, she had to not just have breakfast together, but build a chicken coop, mow grass, build a fence, but for the rest of us there was no longer enough health.
well and here i am. eating breakfast at fckn 11 with dirty hair
A good morning is such, when Kārums is waiting in the closet and today the blue clothing will be warn @sauc_mani earrings. 
@latviangrey Chocolate in combination with anything sour. Cherries/strawberries/any berries in chocolate etc. In restaurants such disappointment is caused by desserts “Valron chocolate fondant... with cherry sauce damn.”
@latviangrey @Reinis_Me I mostly ate in the evenings
@Kilkuts Ventspils market. On Saturdays. White-and-blue striped awning. Brilliant chicken and pork jellies.
@WilmaLinda Breakfast flakes with apple juice :D
I found a video with a visitor to "Kūriņš" who refused to eat without a Colorado tape. I translated: - who are you? WHO ARE YOU, to tell me... TO TELL ME, a real local patriot, what to do??? Many have gathered here who cant say nor boo, nor bee in my language... #9May
@JeteBurkanciema @jtaurens I don't remember that combination. I remember boiled fish with boiled cabbage - it was horrible, but that's not why I didn't have a desire to eat cabbage or fish.
@HairsprayQ My culinary flight occasionally reaches up to cheese salad pastries. But I must admit that I'm buying salads and pastries already pre-made, and I just put the salad in them, respectively.
@arturscukurs So I walked up to the same hut opposite the cinema Gaisma, pulled out a pack of hundred rubles, peeled exactly one ruble from that batch, bought ice cream for twenty kopeck, got the change, stuffed it back into my pocket, happily collected my ice cream and walked back through the bachelor park.
@elinakursite @Kilkuts Probably those who can't cook / haven't eaten good jelly, or just don't eat meat.
@my_rita I think the saleswoman in the meat shop remembers me as a freak. I bought meat on a regular basis, once like this, then like that. I once bought a hotdogs and asked how they should be cooked. I thought she was going to leave with a heart attack 
I'm not saying anything, but the new vekeburger in hesītis is a very good meatless option at the respective price (80 cents)! I usually take one burger and one big burger meal to get two burgers!
@kasparslicitis @Dzintris But the food is tasty and at affordable prices... that's why it's already full.
@ancetarvida @briedisunrepshe what? he didn't mean literally that by eating mushrooms, his computer would start producing visualizations physically in his place, but had meant it as subtext? And my suggestion , if you want the computer to  start physically drawing visualizations, you should eat LSD was a waste of time... ;(
The first ripe strawberries in the "Ar B Agro" farm of the county Tukums Sēme parish, tasted by @sandradiezina. On Friday, strawberries cost €12/kg. https://t.co/TRFTxUNfpq
@briedisunrepshe @ancetarvida @EsEsmuTuEsmuEs better eat LSD, but only with someone who has used it before...
okey, but like, since when do I like buckwheat?
@WilmaLinda Meatballs with onion and mint tea
how does one like the regular dynamite taste? it tastes like metal
Chinese super doctor Aņšī Zedun says the best tea against cough covid-19 and corruption is cowslip tea! https://t.co/NMfB4dM2A4
@WilmaLinda Potato dumpling milk soup. A green cucumber with honey.
The first batch was bought out! If you like it so much - we got it again. Cheers! 
@WilmaLinda White bread with sour cream and a little bit of salt. Onions and garlic chopped, mixed with mayonnaise and black pepper and on dark bread. Freshly pressed juice of 2 apples, 2 lemons and big ginger root-overthrower, which not many can drink and noone likes 
coffee and cigarette and fa... this time only a fart in the pants 
JELLY!!!!!!!!!! https://t.co/kxHGbDLTQw
@NeilaKrave @vaiarine @karlis_arajs If the body is not predisposed to it, an expensive pleasure! For me not to eat meat would take some 5 avocados and at least 300 g of almonds per day.
@WilmaLinda I veeeery, so veery like white bread+butter+honey it's my childhood taste 
@AndzejMic @WilmaLinda Oh yes, this is mine too. I usually wonder when someone tastes it and doesn't express delight.
1920 - I'm sending you my latest verses for a critical insight. - Oh, my dear... If you knew, with what pride I read your poetry in front of a small group of breakfast eaters on the outside terrace this morning. Paragraphs fabulous, language - talented. 2020 - Did you listen to the piece? - Yep :)
@WilmaLinda I mix kephir with tomato juice and salt in a half-liter cup.
@elitaveidemane @VRudzitis Somehow the technocracy sirens eat souls
Do you also call crab salad “crabbers”?
@_evija Rapeseed ice cream 
@AndraKaupe @vaiarine @karlis_arajs You think that not eating meat is “normal” only if you don't like it or not allowed due to health issues?
The housemates are demanding pork chops. 😍 ❤ Oh my, how I'm tired of all that cooking! 🥴 🙄
@knipinska I thought they'd eat that poor person. Well, nature is ruthless and these live shows give a good insight.
There is work, dangerous work, and work in Ireland in the meat processing industry during the pandemic. https://t.co/ji8aO6COzT
Pour vanilla ice cream mass in a bowl, refrigerate properly, then place in the freezer and mix thoroughly at least four times every 15 minutes. Do it until the mass has thickened properly Let it taste well 😋 @Spilthethea_lv
@ZiemasEzis @SPLITTERIS @SPKCentrs Walks, eats and sleeps with a mask.
- Pour milk and sweet cream into a saucepan. Cut the vanilla bean lengthwise, clear the seeds and flesh: put both the scraped flesh and the pod in liquid. Stir in half the sugar, boil, remove it from the fire and let it  retract for 20 minutes.
@LieneBs Ogubāze (find it on Facebook) but I saw that they raised prices a lot (I was buying a box of strawberries for 12.50, just now the offer was 21 eur/box).
My first harvest. Yes, yes, just a salad that don't require special care, but pride is still great ☺ ️ The bitterness is created by the fact that someone has dented my favorite @VaidavaCeramics bowl and won't admit, but there will be salad. Despite the dent! https://t.co/UunqjsEBv4
I am eating an orange in the shower
@Vents_Zvaigzne The cabbage juice needs to be packed in champagne bottles. So that the bitter gases hold.
Good increases good! Mols along with friends from the confectionery Sala and Hospiss LV, are visiting medical workers to deliver warm lunches and thank them for working all these months. Let us continue to delight our medics until May 12, delivering 1000 meals in total. https://t.co/PllREmIP5k
@KrischaKrisch @cepum_s Ah, well then it's completely ok! We have 1x a month. I am, of course, also pleased that there is such an offer and opportunity. During this time they really eat absolutely everything and a bit more:-))
@normundsbergs Then you are proposing to distort the free market in which the consumer himself decides to give €5 to the merchant, stipulating that the country should choose individual merchants who will deliver everyone their lunch?
@ArvisKolmanis @DzeneDace Is there no more meat in the freezer?
@LindaLauzeL Fundamentals must be placed today:) The second coffee will have to be consumed with a roof:)
@VinetaPu Every morning for breakfast - leaves, cucumber, tomato, radish, mocarella, Turkish peas, pesto along with an omelet in all sorts of ways. Also while watching a movie or reading instead of “something chewable.”
@VinetaPu Put in a finely cut Greek salad, any vegetable curry or tomato-lentil soup. Surely king Humus without a say :)
@ruslansbiserovs 8 years old, I asked my mother to give me a taste of a beer, I still like beer
@artis_dobrajs @GaumigsJoks @EinarsCilinskis Yes. Polonium tea is just as illogical. To accept this and Novičok there must be another factor that would give logic to everything. I hope something like that will someday be revealed. In the meantime, as the only factor is being presented - Putin is a mentally ill maniac with a tendency to show off in absurd ways.
@thislifeer @meta_sniedze @KannaRagnesse How long has he been working there? Family and I (6 people) were at Forest for a festive dinner on November 18, 2018, the food was very mediocre, not in line with the price. It wouldn't go a second time for sure. There are other much better restaurants in Riga. It doesn't deny the fact that your friend is good at cooking, just experience.
It took a global crisis, a pandemic, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people to finally start covering the buns in stores
@cepum_s @LiepinLiva We have a tradition in place before the distanching - everywhere with lunch boxes, a tea thermos and for me coffee in a thermal cup. For the kids it's an adventure, for me - more economical :D
@meta_sniedze Some Romeo, ibio... everyone knows how it ended up.. danuna... (In Purčiks beer tastes better!)☺️
@dianchuuz That's not good. You need to eat properly. You need fruit, vegetables, and meat (if you're not vegan) because the organism needs everything. Of course the organism knows itself what it needs. I can, for example, not eat meat for months, but then eat it again. But if you don't eat anything then you will not have energy
@vardotaja I think there can be at least 1 step between a favorite and can be eaten.
@meta_sniedze I could eat quite a lot for a moment  after the birth of my child that I didn't understand where that food was fitting. 
@ddzr_a @bobijsvelns She needs to get the right proportion. There in my time they were making 5 spoons of meat sauce powder to a half-glass of water, of course there would be a shit. From scratch, I would try to make it this way, but I wouldn't put whiskey and sweet cream, just simply reduce some some beef broth. https://t.co/koKloAqUf3
I treated “neck pain” like crazy for a week and was already panicking about the virus until I realized today that my throat was burning with stomach acid. And that's now that I'm finally eating better/more correctly/more often than ever? How ironic! Yes, yes, stress is already at the super level. 
@_liiga Yeah, mine also get mad occasionally when the terns want to eat their babies, but they successfully repel them. The cats, who are hanging out down by the tree, are also attacked.
I got a bitten in my hand by something and I don't feel my skin in a circle around that bite, wtf

@UllaPerkune Marinate at least 24h, better soak up, better taste, keep in a cool place - refrigerator, cellar. Coal - “Marienburg” some of the best, long grizzing, hot, can get them in “Kurši.” Put pieces of meat close together, but not to squish.
@UllaPerkune Any type of meat. Very hot coal. Frequently turn over while frying to fry from all sides. For sauce - mayonnaise, water, kephir, tomato sauce, can be mixed. Add: cut or grated - onions, garlic, spices. Vinegar - a little for the taste, do not to exaggerate. Do not add sugar. Salt by taste.
@miculis @realKrivenchy We should learn from Dārta and drink schnapps like real men in sips like apple juice!!!
@SoosaarD Start gathering children, you will quickly learn to lie awake, see with ears, hear with your skin, run to several sides, lay your bed with your foot, eat faster than in the army, and become inadequate at the doctors :)
I couldn't eat avocado bread in any way this morning. I have to admit it at last - I don't like avocados. Am I going to become a boomer? Are Lynch courts of millenials  going to come over my head? Am I going to start liking the harpsichord and Brainstorm? The future is now very uncertain.
@bibaiba I was in Finland on a business trip, on the way to dinner I suddenly met a friend who had recently moved there. I met him on his birthday in a town 120 km from his place of residence.
FOOD You can eat what you want if you are a growing organism, BUT eat sweets with caution, don't eat (often) “fast food”, etc. And if you want to thin down then don't do it with fasting, it can be very damaging to your body because your body won't get vitamins and substances that are needed
Before the festivities @Zemkopibas_min etc. called for the purchasing of food produced in Latvia. I would also add plant producers. If someone needs tomato, cabbage plants, flowers or berry bushes - look for the nearest plant producer. It's not easy for them right now. Big and small markets are not happening. #atbalstisavējo !
And really,you're going to eat me ?!!!
This reminds me: You want a stew for dinner? Children: Yeees!!! No, not ice cream, but vegetable stew with chicken. Children: #&¥§{#+-!!!!!
@agijakola I'm so surprised at how rare people eat stews. 
@agijakola Cabbage- carrot I ate a week ago. Then I threw some of it into beetroot soup the next day. On the third day, a lot of chilli powder in addition to the beet soup. Stew marathon. 
@S_Simplicitas @Mara_ar_putniem @tandemnieks yeah, that is true. That was if you wanted to eat (Nan did it?)
@MammaTvito Oh, a lot of everything. Chocolate like iron, liver pate  completely the most disgusting thing in the world. All cabbage like mould.

@realKrivenchy Usually, casual folk get up in the mornings, go to the toilet, eat breakfast, watch TV, read the media, work, rest, get sick, die, get married, scratch their noses, scratch their bottom. The homeland guards see it all as a struggle.

@nenormamma I'm already sickened when I wash water bottles - they're being stained even through a straw. I don't even want to talk about the fact that food is thrown in a cup while eating.. I hold my breath and pour the contents of the cup into the pot with my eyes closed. 
@LieneBrizga It depends. When I made it, seven people ate.
@JankaPipars Didn't you understand what I was talking about? About you not eating with a fork... :) All your sarcasm, which you devote to Russia, unfortunately to the same extent can be devoted to Latvia, where “there was no” Covid, no one died, but it was revealed that the whole funeral office was sick. Let's better start with pulling your log out of the eye... :)
@debes_manna Judging from the leaves, visible in the picture are some type of root crops from the cabbage family - radish or turnip, not a parsnips, but the pleasure of working in the garden does not diminish it. :)
@bibaiba Yeah, we appreciated this. Also raspberry and blackcurrant that really tastes “berrily” :) But I don't understand those new squares without a stick. How do you eat them??

@bibaiba Pols also has a normal size ice cream in a waffle cup :) https://t.co/gBL047UggL
@pragsmacktics I used to eat more, but often had nausea, however it might also come from not chewing properly.
Where is the booze? Flowers are planted in wine boxes afterwards at home. :D
@HienaNeija Who gets a table, who the actual lunch ;).
BIG FACTS!
Such overeating!!!
@uldisz @CSDD_LV Mhm, and I also don’t like ice cream SO MUCH anymore... :D But in general congratulations and let it roll well and stop safe! :)

@MartinsAbolins The cracks already exist. When I read that in the idle allowance, some good “creative” receives as much as my salary (working in medicine in these circumstances-with a limited number of PPE, under stress and WITHOUT any premiums), I get sick. Meanwhile, they are baking cakes and watch the sunsets in their homes. Fair?

@KaivaAnna Coffee – Innocent/MiiT, and actually Caffeine is also dear to my heart.
@LadyyWollff @guntiskalnins @GMeluskans A McDonalds burger is also not a 'real' product. I've eaten one nice veg burger in Sweden, which doesn't taste like meat at all, and also a few in the work café in Sweden which were very ok. Same with falafel. Even non-vegetarians like to experiment with something new.
@baletomaanija I can't roll my tongue in a cornet. It has plagued me all my childhood. I am also panicking if I have to peel potatoes with a knife, thank God for the vegetable pealer.
@Rihards_St @GMeluskans It's a problem with the belief that all vegetarians are the same, although there are hardcore vegetarians who don't eat it, there are ones who haven't fully refused meat or who have a desire for something that resembles meat and then there are the posers + meat eaters who sometimes try this out
@ms_logina Those buns in Rimi plastic
Japanese experiment to visualize how viruses are spreading - fluorescent staining applied to one person's hands. 10 people ate together. After checking in 30 minutes - everyone got color, 3 of them on the face.

@Ilja_Polakovs @ultragreat1 You recommend reading it to me... you mention Spain yourself, why didn't they go to free it, but demolishing Europe were going to the “holy land” When it was holy not just for the Europeans :) The crusades were the same kind of rescuing Europe as saving a neighbor while along the way raping his daughter, slaughtering his son eaten dog
@akmanstors @Vinnta1 Let's hope for the best. My nan at least promised not to rush with the planting of tomatoes in the greenhouse and listen to her Bricītis tonight. 
With the old apple on the river shore, he had two horses on the other side. A little rain rained at about noon. It rained more later, so I didn't get to plow from noon until the afternoon. After the afternoon it cleared up, and then I could plow again.
@Ruksane @SkujaVilnis @KasparsFunts someone snacking with eggs and stretching from nest/s. From the prints on the eggs, the culprit can be identified. It may be a crow, a magpie, can also be a dog. A mink and a marsh harrier usually eats on the spot.

When moving to live in the countryside, what has been the biggest negative surprise you weren't prepared for. My appetite and courage for wild animals.
I hadn't been to Eland until now. Now we ordered a holiday dinner from there. Not cheap, but generally enjoyed it.
@ultragreat1 @h_side Well, read something about the crusades! Also look at the Spanish history (including the origins of the reconquista), the origins of the Madrid name... These were arguments not so much about what name to call God, but about culture, laws, such banal things like meat eating, etc.
@spigana She eats anything that I make. If you don't count too spicy foods, there hasn't been anything she wouldn't say that is tasty. #TheQueenOfCooking

@ArtursBridaks I've had a double happiness with everyone else for not hearing that sauce in the sentence
@TInzenieris @LVceli It would be cool to see your vision. I don't know how to deal with a crossing at strawberry street, because there's a big narrowing there, and there's a great need for a pedestrian/bike lane.
@Naktene @DvinuMamma You don't eat fish and any animal products - milk, eggs?
I'm making breakfast.I see a woman behind the window and starting to talk to the janitor.I thought it was nice to have a chat,probably about life. Community!Friendship! After a while I open the window,I understand that the'conversation'is a accusations to the janitor Ok.Somehow like that in my childhood the illusions that the world was lovely were broken
@ofija_ @Naktene Meat can also be eaten by everyone. It's not a nut allergy, so it's just a fantasy. Meat on the table, well, don't eat.
@liana_langa Stems don't interfere, but leaves fresh can be cut to salads - very healthy!
Breakfast 
@Driafre @ArvisKolmanis @ZPupola It's more simple. Eating a small moderately reasonable amount of bird meat per month is much easier than following a correct diet as a vegan/vegetarian. Less chance to fuck up. Another thing is that most people eat way too much (even unhealthy) quantities of meat.
@ZPupola It's interesting in general that while eating meat myself, I've never met that mythical, aggressive vegan, but a chorus of meat eaters crying at least on soc. nets is on every step.

@bizenajs @garamgajejs among others, he was the first to taste those Carnilove chips and admit then to being tasty. 
Is 5:15, I’m drinking wine, eating cake and playing sudoku.
in the nearby shop I saw a very large pack of crisps about one euro sixty-five and bought without thinking for long. I came home, opened it and was surprised - in place of sour cream and onion flavor it was dill. and needless to say that dill chips are some of my most unloved ones. 
@IvarsNeiders @J_Radins It's already accurate. so the carnivore has to be sure about the origin of the meat to compare the effects of the omnivore and vegetarian.
I have vegan kid sausages at home, I don't know what's going on at all now
@DW_Immurs @ZPupola @ms_logina There are vegans who do this for mind and body freedom and they have a problem with the volume of fake meat Sodium, which on the one hand is right, too much is not good and one must check how much is there. There are also those who think that vegans can’t like meat. It's a bit more stupid.

@VentsAKrauklis A gypsy complaining to a neighbor: kids have become very picky, not eating egg soup (eats boiled eggs himself, gives the liquid to the kids):)
I ate a lot of meatballs, I’m happy
@maljorka I do it like that sometimes and I very much like the taste of simply vegetables with salt.
Yesterday I found greetings from both children in my mailbox (Thank you also @latvijas_pasts!) and when going to sleep the boy spontaneously smothered me with countless kisses (it never happens), now I’m enjoying breakfast in bed while the little ones are baking a cake with Daddy in the kitchen. Pure happiness. ♥️
The morning started magically due to 3 reasons. The first - the fantastic warmth given to us by the sun. ☀️ Second - the every morning jog that makes every cell in the body wake up.

I want chocolate ice cream
@frakcija @lastguru_net That's what they don't support. It's not beneficial for them that people eat healthy and live long. Too much pension to pay.
@DvinuMamma On the spot cooked herring ice cream is served on a freshly scrambled and flame-heated egg white. It must be said, it was Estonians. Currently the so-called Nordic fusion is popular there.
@Naktene my dog gets fresh meat only from hunting and then, even-toed ungulates, or neighboring lamb. I don't believe the raw meat in the market...
@atheist_from_lv I've never cooked meat dishes in my life. If I tried to cook, it would probably be, first of all, vomited, second, unenjoyable. If friends want meat or alcohol, they bring it to me themselves. I do not impose anything on anyone.
@atheist_from_lv Because it would be unkind to guests? Omnivores usually eat carrots and peas, but vegetarians don't eat chicken hearts. In other words, it would be irrelevant for some, but for others like a blow of the hammer to their necks. Therefore, perhaps you should not, if you respect the ones you invite as guests.
@GMeluskans Well good morning :D people choose not to eat meat for ethical reasons. Regarding taste - it’s good
next time when vegans come to visit, I'll serve a carrot-pea stew, but instead of carrots, chicken hearts, and stomachs instead of peas. Well then everything is chill, if you can substitute meat in a cutlet with a soy, why on the other way around?!
@ArvisKolmanis @GMeluskans Btw, I don't hate that people eat meat — I understand, they’re used to it — but, for example, tofu lets you expand the horizon. In the end, in the Asian dishes, especially Japanese, it appears quite a lot.
@reallygayTM2 for breakfast ganja+jintonic. for dinner cottage cheese with radishes and cucumber
@gerda_c If you don't count picking tea, then selling draft beer and snacks in big concerts (Elton John, Depeche Mode etc.). The unused barrels remained for us. We poured it in empty bottles of lemonade from trash cans .. It was a good time :D
@gerda_c But my first favorite job was in the summer when I was 15 and I was selling ice cream at Vecāķi beach. That was the life. I was selling it right at the station, people were around only when the trains came, during the rest of the time I was reading books (circa one a day), and eating a lot of ice cream.
@depresivakuce I think of other people as pieces of cake when I say, “i'd like a piece of that cake” lmao
@Eriks_the_Great @Ingridaa_S @ArvisKolmanis @VRudzitis Then don’t. Is the measure of your values bloody pieces of meat which you show off publicly? I, for example, don't care about them.
How cardboard tastes. And all that is in the wrong century.
I like orange juice, but I'll never drink it on it’s own
@bobijsvelns I like elvis or festivalburgers
I ate McDonald’s in honor of the independence of Latvia
One family's children - one wants dumplings for dinner, the other - steamed vegetables!
I've got some kind of housewife channel open. Potato scones with cheese and chicken chops tonight.
Tried strawberry-rhubarb crumble today at the suggestion of @dacegrr, it vanished faster than ever! Mega good. ^_^ And others typed their recipes next to my tweet, there are sources for drawing inspiration.
@Egitazz @DobelesDzirnavn Try with other rice maybe.
I want to eat strawberries on a summer evening so it sounds like a song.
@krizdabz convenience? not that when you make coffee in a normal espresso machine, you have to chop 20 beetroot furrows in parallel, jopta.
@krizdabz Can just be applauded while standing for this invention. Coffee for EUR 10 kg + a pile of plastic waste for 50 kg. (i.e. approximately that proportion). Something is wrong with our society in general. A normal coffee machine pays off within a couple of kg!
in half a minute. When ready, PUT ON YOUR GLOVE (your fingers will still be useful) and pull it out. As it cools off, make coffee, pile buns on the plate and bring them to the bed with such a face that it would have been simple. Please, dear women, enjoy it! Your job is to stay in bed and not disturb.
@KristineStend @ArvisKolmanis A communist will sin when eating a pork snout or grey peas.
@kasparszellis Afterwards we celebrated all night in my house with friends. We drank VanaTallinn(for Baltic unity! 
Me: damn, I need to start eating less, or I'm gaining weight. Everyone else: you're already skinny anyway. My brother later sees me eating already another time: No, you really need to stop eating so much. At the same time, me: Oh, I'll bake some buns today. 
@IlzeJaunberga Bad PR for dandelions 
@Kristap_s I'll be waiting very much ;) It was a pleasure to meet “in person” :) Let the taste be good :)
@ArvisKolmanis You have to combine lunch, breakfast and dinner in one meal! ☝
Are your mothers also calling early in the morning and congratulating on the day of the independence of Latvia? Prosecco and cakes in red-and-white tones are likely to be missed out this year.
I’m going to steal chocolate from the pantry!! thanks co-star!!! https://t.co/H6rWW9pJgz
In elementary school, if I’m not mistaken about in third grade, the teacher allowed eating sweets during the lesson, because it was her Birthday. It was a literature lesson in which I was selected to read, but I couldn't because I was busy with ice cream.
@ritaignate In the middle of this interview, it's about why wormwood tea helps https://t.co/vcxTNZhtfU
That scent! I very much hope that coffee will help me to wake up and start the day. https://t.co/68lVZWrbza
To ask for a piece of cake?
@ritaignate @KasparsFunts There is no need for sugar in yeast bread. For coffee (good) also no. Even milk already seems to be a desecration of good coffee. But it's hard to bake a roll biscuit without sugar. I put honey in pancakes (dissolved in warm milk). If sweets are made at home... then laziness ideally reduces sugar consumption.
@ritaignate @PandaElijah And what's the point of refusing products with added sugar but eating apples in large volumes which have sugar?
@_evija Absolutely agree. And isn't it so that these fantastic feelings are being suppressed by perfectionists who have to eat everything from the same plates? 
@pelnin @regejss absinthe is similar but at least 50 %! there tastes like liquorice
Something didn't go well there with filming. And that food has had to be stored in the cellar for about 3 days. When it was finally able to be consumed, the food had already been slightly weak. It ended up so that I felt or read everything from the actors, he he. I respect such revelations. #pusnaktsmurdziņi I hope I didn't dream of this

@Reinis_Me @LusisToms The microwave is a best device in the kitchen. Sometimes there is disagreement when cold food is removed from it on a hot plate, but in general a very useful thing.
@RuditeV With endless work,fatigue. Mom at the hospital,husband also got sick.The direct work is burning,but buns for bridge guards must be smeared. To the hospital.In the evenings, gotta walk around the apartments of Ķengarags for election agitation. Russians,Russians,Russians. Oh God,how many of them!
Could a white wine with orange juice be called Vininosa? I haven't posted any instastory for 5 days. I usually put up to 10 a day. All sorts of random stuff. Texture, perspective, cat, mood, inspiration, taste, scent. The hangover started today. Come on, chérie, come on.

@LieneBrizga And especially growing children! Who are moving! I sympathized with the families with teenagers! Milk! Eggs! Bread! How quickly can you eat out the entire closet!!!!!
@pragsmacktics I hate unorganized store shelves. I can't pass if someone drops, canned peas on a pasta shelf. Must be put in place. Or crookedly placed products. If tea packs are not neatly in line or juice packs are standing in a chaotic way.. If I get to hell, it will look like Rimi in the late evenings.
@AValdbergs @AnsisPupols @Sarmite_Kolate some here have become lax! An true Latvian boils pearled and eats with herring. It's the same as sushi, just without all its poking with bamboo bands. The scumbags don't know how to make a proper spoon from linden. They don't even know how to make in brine barrels - they call it soy sauce and spread it at the table
The daughter is eating breakfast and suddenly out of nowhere: "Daddy has the biggest cheeks of all of us! " It must be noted that thin are both Daddy and his cheeks. 
Yes. Birds are also in despair. I sat on a bench in the empty Vecrīga to eat ice cream. There, a totally fearless and well-organised sparrow group almost beat me and tried to take it away. I barely protected it.
Especially tasty with the first greens! Whole-milk cottage cheese “Limbažu piens” at a spring-like price in LsTS shops! https://t.co/s0fhBY9R3W
@anita_muizniece Better to pick the little fresh leaves + flowers. More delicious, interesting sour-sweet taste. The fresh leaves can be eaten just like that - delicious!
@bebitsvaig I was told by my family doctor that kids are mood eaters too. There are days when you can barely eat something and the days when you eat like a lumberjack. And everything is all right. Because I'm a little worried about eating, we have a fine guy, though both me and my husband are puffy. Then there are many comimg up asking if we are feeding him at all.
@fluffy_mia @ancetarvida @eiduss @Kilkuts Try the buns at the corner of Pērnavas/Barona - the chanterelle ones are the bomb!
Me when I eat something : wow I feel huge like a big obese bitch 
@krizdabz I used to be proud of working 14 hours a day and 6 days a week, sleept little, ate just about anything, didn't move at all. One day I found myself being a fat, ugly, tired, sickly, sweaty paps. Since then, I have managed to better myself at least a little, but that needed willpower!

One at night. Maybe I've already told you, but when I live with my parents, I was never allowed to eat ice cream with a spoon from the box because it's rude. Now it’s all I do—forget about the bowls. https://t.co/eLy1vWboBH
@DDzrve Nothing is better than potatoes. You can't consume so much. I ate three plates, now I’m suffering.

@kasparszellis Is there anyone, besides the legendary Grišāns, who has been on a “tour” on the blood of Rezekne checka, pieces of meat and cellars full of boiled prisoners? The fact that Antoņina Brasla did not travel from Tilža, is sort of clear. Oh yes - how long and often did those excursions occur?
@reallygayTM2 for breakfast canned peach and a bowl of raspberries for lunch beans with corn cheese salad wrapped in lavash for dinner leftovers from lunch and half of a chocolate bar
I was by the cats. They had just finished eating and then came an arrogant owner's cat (with a strap). She got her ass kicked by some unknown, who just stuffed his head under the fence. The fighting began and the shameless was expelled. Of course I was on the side of the bums! No one will take food away from the poor. Wtf! 
@gerda_c At one strawberry plantation, I was weeding the beds and picking strawberries for a few days too. I work with two retired and fun ladies.
I was eating my work lunch quietly today until my boss sat down with me to talk about Russian influence in Latvia. I realized I didn't have an opinion about it at all. Just so much that not knowing Russian has always affected my possible job positions.
@krista_japina @gerda_c When the ice cream melted, did you also lick 1/3 of it quietly and sold it off? 
@ZaneGaisa @KrischaKrisch Okay, okay, I'm not with the supporters of fruitless and vegetableless packets, I just know that there would be a more lush at damaged vegetables.

@birzniecepaula Rīslings :) can't name a specific firm, I don't buy Rimi wine. You can also check where Cataratto comes up - a group of nutmeg, - gives sweetness. Crudo once was. Gewurztraminer can also be taken safely, not really Elzasas (it may taste like marinade), but the others easy.

@KasparsFunts I once lifted a hedgehog from the road with great excitement. Epic fail-bit for real!

@VilksTavsBiedrs @DzeneDace Tea increases weight because you need smthn to eat along
@Nodusgordius @phronemophobe No such restriction is necessary in a democratic society. The majority might want to ban the eating of hot dogs because they prefer sausages, but that doesn't mean such a ban is necessary. Latvia is a free country, it should be celebrated, instead of crawling in the direction of RU!

@Sarmite_Kolate A kiosk and the weighted vanilla or chocolate ice cream. In plastic bags. That taste is not restorable. Very. 
@_evija similar with Haribo bears - first eat the yellows, then oranges, then reds, whites and greens. and only two together, there are no other options.
Simply put, I think it's come to me too early to be saying “I don't need anything” when I just want to sit on the terrace and look at the sunset with a cup of mint tea in my hands. Nowhere to run, nothing to be achieved. Everything IS THERE anyway.
@anita_muizniece Mostly tea , pick, dry on a newspaper and make tea!
@libarte @Austra That too. I've cooked a few times, the result was so pitiful that I'd rather go to the store even in covid times. Or not eat bread.
@sori_man_galax bruh I guess I eat too rarely, because I haven't eaten them during the quarantine at all.
Hey, but please, when travelling around the Baltic States, be responsible! What should be known about LT: 1. Masks are mandatory in LT in all public spaces. When eating in a restaurant or cafe, you may remove the mask, but you should still take the mask with you everywhere - today a woman without a mask was expelled from a shop.
@skaabiite I braced myself... and also ate

I guess I've not yet gotten an easy ticket.

Rather often, in discussions with carnivores, an assumption appears that animals survive off of sun and air. Namely, people often claim something like this - yes, but if we don't eat meat then we'll have to grow more vegetables.
@IvarsNeiders Growing vegetables degrades the planet more than livestock farming. This is demonstrated by the tribal transition from growing livestock to farming. It would be good if people could survive off of sun and air ...
@ZPupola @ms_logina I also don't understand these disagreements, especially given that for many the meat substitutes and their similarities to the original help to accept vegan/plant-based nutrition, so gets them to common goal. Nor do I understand the omnivores who pick on vegans who use a substitute product.
@martinsveide @karlis_karlis_ I don't know how delicious it is there, but the main spice is already in use. :) I didn't know about them, but now when I'm going through the Kauguri, I'm sure I'll find them and eat there :)
@aaboliiga1 @IvarsNeiders @GMeluskans Where is there any context with boletes? People just can't eat meat and therefore make meat surrogates. That's what @GMeluskans wanted to learn
Christians laugh at Muslims and practising Jews for not eating bacon, but are they all aware that pigs eat everything, really everything, including people FUCKING EWW
@ZPupola @GMeluskans I think it is hypocrisy though. In order to grow vegan food, an uncountable number of living creatures are killed. Is it more ethical than killing “directly” for eating? If we don't want to eat meat - let's not eat it, but there's something wrong with ethics there.
@Laurisrenpreis1 We've never consumed as much meat as in the 21st century. The consequences are appalling.
@Bertaane @HienaNeija @bebitsvaig @PunciPunci @Mara_ar_putniem @Agy_1988 @Dzinja @K_Tronenkova @Shakalinda super! Thank you! Cowslip tea is my favorite of herbal teas. Very tasty! Pick whole bags and dry! 
@annabezmiegs I think the discussion between meat-eater and non-eater is usually doomed to failure. And so it can go to absurdity from one side, and the other. I agree with the version that man has developed this way due to eating meat, not the other way around. It has nothing to do with ethics. Everyone has their own conviction
@Gulips Unfortunately in Latvia a large proportion of the population consumes meat products produced abroad. Ethics is in place when animal welfare on farms is studied. Chickens in cages, tortured pigs...
@IvarsNeiders @selmuushh @GMeluskans Soyshlik can be ordered to home from Nata Cafe, pickled in a bucket. It tastes so much like meat that I doubted for a moment that it was not meat.
@apmaldijos it does affect, because we regularly ship food in exports to both the Middle East and to Africa.. Food will only become more expensive in Europe and America.., which also means a lower quality diet for low-income earners, that is not famine, but also not good.

@Egitazz @KristineGarina @RozeIeva If there can be a conviction that you can't eat meat, also I may have the opposite, meat must always be there, AS simple as fuck!
@evka30 @Silkans you shouldn't read while eating! let that be a lesson! :)
@atheist_from_lv @Egitazz @RozeIeva Sure, but you don't think that meat should always be eaten BY EVERYONE? So, for vegans, one food would be OK if they came to visit? I don't know, of course, what non meat-eating people are among your friends, but I've never banned anyone from eating meat. I don't want to eat meat. The others are eating.
@maljorka Not everyone has demanding taste buds & that's fine. At the same time, for many it seems that making normal salads means grinding, chopping and struggling with vegetables for half an hour.
@Egitazz Yup, exactly from chocolate was I inspired. I like the taste of spicy things a lot.
@LaurisBisenieks @J_Radins The discussion is mainly based on industrial farming. And most of the meat you can buy has been produced industrially. However, a natural meadow can certainly exist without livestock (even organic). And we haven't even started talking about ethics yet.
For the first time this year, I rode in heavy rain. Hood, backpack, panting - everything you need. I was smarter and I put a vegetable box on my trunk so that I wouldn't crush my darlings 
the very most strange way to say you don't like tomatoes and cucumbers...
@ZPupola @KaarlisKK @Driafre @ArvisKolmanis Ok)) I'm not a vegetarian, but eating only poultry for a long time, I have come to the point that I can hardly eat other meat, which makes me think org.can be trained to other changes as well.
@maljorka Salads are a overrated.
After viņķele 
I'm fascinated by people who don't respect the time of others, schedules etc. Today I was left with 10 minutes to cook and eat lunch! :)
Others: I commit to running a marathon, giving up smoking, starting to wake up earlier Me: I won't eat chips for a week The week has passed and I feel very proud of my achievement. :D
Because a fat person doesn't become inadequate by eating another burger. Unlike a drunk who needs more.
@maljorka I abnormally like the taste of tomatoes. I adore simply sliced ones with pepper and salt and balsamico on top. Good addition for breakfast cheese buns, lunch, etc. I can also simply eat tomatoes with great pleasure, without anything added, especially if they are home grown. One of the best things in the world :)
There are days when you put on your dress and get ready before you come to the office at the other end of the apartment, and then later arrange an though through lunch beautifully on the plate. But then there are days like this - I won't get into the details describing the clothing, but for lunch I eat just some blend of jar contents from a pot
I've always liked the taste of all fresh vegetables, even on school field trips I took fresh paprika as a snack, for example. A few years ago I took a bus to Berlin, for snacking as always vegetables. There was a strange guy sitting next to me, shocked loudly that someone was eating something so horrible. :D
@ArvisKolmanis @ZPupola Even here appear the simple-minded, belligerent carnivores :( I get physically sick from meat dishes. Why is it propagated so much?
- Octopi can use their tentacles to taste and smell food. -Everyone knows chameleons change color, but they can also move each eye in different directions and look at different places. -a turkey changes the color of its head depending on mood.

@mazaismurdzins take either blood medicine tea or some anxiolytic - you've been continuing to react to my tweets on several occasions, despite having unfollowed me.
@Egitazz @RozeIeva @atheist_from_lv Ah yes, mayonnaise… Harder for vegans, but this one is not really with an evil intent. They just don't think through. I don't eat many desserts due to gelatin and then there's a long explanation of why. I understand that it's not someone with the specific intention wanting to feed bones to me. :))

@a_beinarovica cut meat into slices, beat with a meat hammer (if it’s chicken, then don't beat it), I soak it in soy sauce, then in flour, then in a beaten egg, then oil on the pan - self cost if meat is bought at discounts, around 5 euro / 1kg of chops
@maljorka Hahah, but what's wrong with that? I sometimes, for example, make an omelet and put cucumber pucks outside of it in a circle like a sun. I don't have Instagram, just as much as my own pleasure. But the main thing is to eat those vegetables, no matter how you design them.
@maljorka I specifically don't like it when everything is mashed together, I like eating things separately. In soups and others too everything in large chunks to feel the individual taste of each ingredient.
Limits on gathering are set to 25 people, which makes you think that birthdays and all other celebratory days are allowed to be celebrated in a wider circle! Therefore, bigger cakes and more snacky tables are needed… https://t.co/lBzfB3x5Oe

@ArtaLiene Inside is very good: coffee, a chair, a desk, a computer, big plans and me.
@karlis_arajs I think the vast majority of meat eaters eat a series of meat-free foods as the main dish or additives, but the vast majority of vegetarians, and particularly vegans à la meat eater food - pork chops, cheese, egg-free confectionery where they should be, are unenjoyable.
Chocolate candy, pickled cucumber, shashlik, marshmallow, pickled cucumber, Coke. It's very difficult to be a woman.
@Martins_Ku @raimondssiferis I work out 5-7 times a week for 1-2 h, my daily diet is balanced, such a fatty dish I eat 2 times a month so that the body has something to struggle with after everyday nutrition. You can not worry about me. :)
@LDF_lv @ChiuljuPussala @Specekozols The name “Meet cattle” alone already means that the sensibility of these animals is lowered to a minimum. It's just for now a walking meat block

@WilmaLinda Sorrel soup was a trauma for a long time from kindergarten times, but then I reluctantly discovered how it tasted with fresh sorrel picked from out own garden, with meat melting on the tongue, with countryside eggs. But like that - the floating islands that seem too sweet to many.

@GirtsRagelis @WilmaLinda I like it this way very much too. One of childhood's favorite dishes. All the while I was sure it was normal to eat like this, until I began to travel, and my Italian, Spanish, even Polish friends blissed their eyes in horror.
@tandemnieks I give the little one canned ones. he eats them up and then shoots 
@_sindija_ Must try this. It won't be worse. Yesterday's beetroot soup didn't find its way to the exit...
@latviangrey cottage cheese with sour cream and jam(from childhood),canned peas with almost all the unsweet dishes. mum can't understand how meat (usually cutlets) with potatoes and cottage cheese tastes together. the least edible from other favorite dishes-tomatoes,any mushrooms,paprika, halva,cielaviņa
@latviangrey oh and I also didn't eat vegetable milk soups,fish soups,rye-bread, and any other rye bread. but I like the membrane of milk soup. I don't eat tomatoes, I don't drink tom.juice,but I use ketchup and t.sauce often.
@WilmaLinda Cake before meat
@tandemnieks Sauerkraut juice, it may seem brilliantly odious for a child, but you don’t need much, just a spoonful. It helped us, but I really don't know how right it was to give such a juice to a then 3-year-old, but it was pretty crazy for us for a moment, then we tried many things.
@INiedzviedze @WilmaLinda Is chocolate jelly with berry jelly as sauce in this category too? (I like both)
@debes_manna Today at 12 he was still in pajamas, playing during breakfast, drawing, gluing and cutting in the forenoon, lunch ignored. I warned him I'd eat and go out to walk. As I went to get dressed, hysteria began with collapsing. Got dressed after all, we cycled for 5 km. Finally, around 14 he ate.
@IvarsNeiders @Imazite @lastguru_net What is there not to understand? In the Soviet days, my mother, a dentist, was always assigned to home visits during the flu epidemic because of a lack of doctors. She had her own method - eating bare garlic. We were also forced. Neither she got the flu, nor us. Why do I have to get a shot? I don't understand 
@phronemophobe No, it's about me not understanding those who at the table loudly announce that they don't eat a product X and therefore won't eat, for example, the soup. If you're allergic, then ok, if not - screw you. My soup, I cook it how I like.
@_skabarga I like having your own recipe in every family. Here I see meat, I don't usually cook it with with meat.
@tvitermaniaks @phronemophobe Why should you eat the soup that someone cooked with product x, and have to twitch at the table while eating that lame pumpkin or coriander?
@briedisunrepshe I poured water from the kettle not into a cup with a sieve, but in the whole jar of loose tea. A completely new jar, 100g...
I bought minced sub-product meat for my dog and cats for €0.43/kg. “Peremol” is selling at the same price now (minced from Rus. lang.), I asked - what is it? It turns out that it is minced sausages, meat products that will expire in a few days. Animals eat and cheer!
@tvitermaniaks @phronemophobe Then you’re in luck. But others have things that they really don't like the taste of. So that it makes you gag. For me it’s lamprey. If available, I try to taste them with the idea that “what if I like the taste this time?” and then I start gagging. It's because of synapses, not beliefs. It shouldn't be taken to one’s heart.
I like eating. 
@latviangrey Cielaviņa, corn of any kind, canned tomatoes (excluding tomato sauces and juice).
@WilmaLinda But I like it very much just like that. Without bread , meatball+onion and a sip of sweet tea 
Wow! I stewed a chicken/vegetable stew from 10 vegetable varieties. Pretty good! How many vegetables are there in total? Oh! Dill on top of everything! So 11!!! Have I gotten a cook's qualification yet or not!?
@leitanekristine Yeah, onions are my enemies ever since childhood, especially fresh ones. Now, around 30 years old, I've learned to eat them in soups, marinades or stews, but also not willingly.
@maardzory I consider a lot of stuff from the listed truly tasty and not really that weird. 
OK, this gets second place. 
@ditakrauze I'll repeat this for the n-th time specifically for you - what I want to say is that I don't think that any one thing tastes so bad not to eat a dish due to it being there. That's what I don't get.
@Silkans Here's a good brand product that is produced at local factories. The same product that is being imported - total shit! And at least 2x more expensive! You won't buy good tea or coffee here... they import pre-packed peat! However, the brands who produce on the spot, and using the raw materials from here are super!
@Bumbuls2 @IntaK04069245 Don’t know. Tomato growers named their business like that and have been working for generations. They probably wanted their countrymen to not be lazy and diligently work in their small gardens.
@WilmaLinda In my childhood when there was nothing else tasty at home - oat flakes+sour cream+sugar+cocoa. But one of the weirdest and most unsavory dishes I can imagine is a fried cow's pre-milk.
I said to someone in my dream today: “I'm going to Turkey today! Now I can only think about staying in Turkey for some 3 months, drinking Turkish tea and living in Istanbul in a little colorful house, as in those Turkish TV shows. How nice it is to dream sometimes:)
today, for the first time, I baked chocolate cookies and the most convenient thing to chop chocolate turned out to be a 5 kg dumbbell the cookies ended up very ugly, but they tasted very norm
@latviangrey @mvanags It’s about Soviet time vanilla. You are a bit too young... . :) Here you can get a Soviet time ГОСТ-made one, and you can characterise it as whoever wants - it tastes excellent and like ice cream, not like soy shit with essences!
@didzisdadzis @didzvein ok, well at least chocolate is marked as in the Latvian cultural canon deserves. it softens the conditions. you can stay to live in Liepna and eat a vanilla Pols. While the remaining territory of Latvia eats Pold classic.
@WilmaLinda Potato pancakes filled with a mixture of sugar+cinnamon.
@iLOVEciepa xl dumplings
@tvitermaniaks For a long time I couldn’t understand why I can't eat coriander, It’s healthy, and half the world is fainting from it, until I learned it was genetic - the taste receptors of some people perceive it as unsavory.
@MercenaryJohnD @pulks @jzigajev @Brivibas36 @krisjaniskarins @Vinkele @veselibasmin @SPKCentrs @Nords @SandisRiekstins I wash my hands diligently, don't shake hands with people, sleep well, eat 4x a day, don't smoke, physical activities and am glad that children can work out too and coaches can continue to educate them. That is very important. Most importantly, safe and secure
@MatissJekabsons @dj_beatmaster I also like fast food very much. Burgers, and pizzas, fries with sauces and bacon... Abnormal. Bulimia manifested in the form of fast food + sport and diarrhea medicine.
@VilksTavsBiedrs Breed dogs are sensitive to everything in general. Over the course of six years I’ve gotten used to the need of special feeding. And sometimes give a drink of beer, because all boys like it.
This one went well down the probe. I recommend to who ever likes mangoes. https://t.co/nBV2LP4Xsl
@skatsnokoka @Vents_Zvaigzne @juriskazha @SigmaLS8361 @frakcija @IMurniece There is just a bag of old clothes... That’s why colleagues from Leta avoided having lunch with him.
Since I don't have food pictures, because everything was eaten at a huge speed, will have to glorify on Twitter: @EzerietisJ has a talent for cooking! I of course for eating 
Dank from Hopalaabrewery 
@GunitaBa @krizdabz Yup, then when you have a celebration then your friends come to eat cake 
I think I am beginning to slightly understand how the kitchen & cooking works Tonight I fried chicken with onions and paprika and milk in a sauce. I added the paprika too late, but otherwise very nice. Māris, 32 years old.
I think I am beginning to slightly understand how the kitchen & cooking works Tonight I fried chicken with onions and paprika and milk in a sauce. I added the paprika too late and I completely forgot to cut the tomato, but otherwise very nice. Māris, 32 years old.
I am eating kebab box, how about you?
Those who don't like me can go to eat death cups
@WilmaLinda Kārums cheese dessert sliced on rye bread (this one doesn't seem strange to me anyway). I also tend to buy a big piece of dorblue cheese from time to time and eat it like an apple, in such big bites, while still in the car at the wheel. My taste buds after such a “bite” are overly happy.
@_skabarga A dog is perfect until it rolls over in some crap, then eats it and later pukes it on your expensive carpet.
@cepuminji No matter how sad it may seem, my sister pours a tea mushroom drink in those bottles. 
@and_kse I have a feeling that these pop up like mushrooms after rain. Because today, out of context, even Vakcīnrealitāte instead of trying to accuse me of something is shooting to the right and to the left. https://t.co/oYotuIR6fx
@liana_langa НТВ “Международная пилорама” Humor show. The liberators can't eat in a restaurant because there is no Russian among the six languages in the menu. And that's in a NATO country.
@loyds25 I could afford something when I achieved something and so I lived. But now everything is the other way around. The future is for those who are prepared to eat ground. Those who expect everything to fall into their hands will also stay at the bar with a bottle in their hands.
The 246th day - there are still no tomatoes... https://t.co/iRTrBzywQ3
@ViktorijaS In our home the situation with stereotypes about eating is really weak, everyone eats as they like. Respectively, the child too, well I only don’t allow to drink soap water...much 
raise your hand if you too drink tea without sugar
@LiepinLiva @annabindere Then why should you spoil buckwheat if you don't want to feel the taste of it? I like buckwheat pancakes with buckwheat taste. In the past I also used to bake oatmeal-salted pancakes, actually, I've been thinking about them again for some time, maybe I'll get myself together to make some. For them, oatmeal flakes, must be soaked in broth from the evening, can be in vegetable broth.
@Florianmustdie tea and coffee without sugar ftw but something sugary on the side is always OK
@ancetarvida @my_rita Oh yes! In the study years, I was not too lazy to go to AB Dambis for the lunch break and eat a sandwich with a view of Vecrīga!
@latviangrey Ox eye or boiled egg yolk, beetroot salad (excluding those made at home), lard, herring in oil, cartilage, liquorice, caramel and vanilla (with rare exceptions).
cold coffee may be a bit disgusting, but occasionally I drink it like that. and it is ok, caffeine does its own.
What new ice cream would you make? — With the taste of the earth. woop. https://t.co/hnEcY8GfRO
In the COVID days of Ķirson's bistro decided that they wouldn't be offering to warm up food anymore, so I am now eating a cold pilaf at work now, because I very much wanted exactly a pilaf.
@elinakursite Did you really eat all of it?
@tandemnieks If they don’t eat much, there's nothing more to be there.. I’m just thinking, if there really, really is nothing “unhealthy” at home to eat, are they really going to starve to death and eat nothing? Did they at least the cold soup? Isn't there something reasonably healthy, non stomach-hardening that’s tasty and can be fed at any time? :)
@sursurs Cold soup is very tasty, because pink, girl color. They usually eat almost the whole small plate. There are few such tasty things. Bead soup with lentils and broccoli. Cooked meat. Now brushing in sliced fresh cabbage. I'll add that candy is hardly eaten, it's not an appetite thief.
50 minutes of fame! Today I got on TV 😲 visiting @robertomeloni on the channel @24tv. We made flat pancakes with fresh apple jam, prepared arugula and strawberry salads, talked about food, triathlon, and family. Thank you for the hospitality, it was great! #ladolcevita https://t.co/EBuDRo7kQv
@atheist_from_lv @jenuufa Don't hunting dogs also taste the prey?
@sursurs Here you could drink for liters. Juices, of course. I dilute them 1:1 with water. So its indifference to sweets has simply shifted towards drinking. Which isn't bad while being sick. Whatever the problem, drink and drink a lot. You need to think about it a lot, yes, because they’ll always eat bare rice.
This is a montage! I eat watermelons a lot and I've never had anything like that inside. Why do people have to be deceived by such fake videos?! https://t.co/8TA4Wq2GHg
I'm looking forward to Sunday, when it'll be warmer, and finally I can spread all of this over the two balconies, put up normal support for tomatoes/pepper, replant herbs, sow salads and other details. I'm SO tired of carrying everything in/out! I'm getting lightly grumpy. #balkondārziņš https://t.co/pxX4fP0ok9
@didzvein Exactly. This is a total “let them eat cakes!” variant.
@DvinuMamma I let the mister quickly pick everything up and ate only that, which was packed. 😁
@MatissJekabsons @Egitazz @B_Inga I can't not eat, then I start to get total powerlessness and depression. I'd rather eat and burn it off while working out. Then I have vitality, energy, confidence in myself... If only I could keep myself eating.
why did I start eating vegan https://t.co/4SQjyTc7aK
Just watched Nicole Kidman eat worms. She did it in a beautiful dress and very classy. https://t.co/OSN0RxW2F9
@ZiemasEzis @sarkanakmens yeah, one eat bats, while others wear masks (but only on public transport). That's all there is, not much to wonder about, but you decide to be with them or against them
TW// nora eat my ass! my neat brown bear!
I’m tasting schnaps, which is 80% alcohol it is quite okay, the old man calls it fire water
if Latvia needs something, then it must be chips with the taste of “tomato and cucumber salad cream”
@AValdbergs @kasparsskincs @TInzenieris Kidney executioner!:) I'm all about classical values in this food product niche (😂) - beer(I very much like Tērvete light:)),wine (favorite),whisky,wine,gin.
@ancetarvida Oh, too many cases like that, especially when working in a bar. Customers have complained about music (not about the volume, but don't like what is being played) that soup is too hot, often eating food completely and then saying it wasn't good and refusing to pay.
my mom noticed that I liked avocados. I now have 16 avocados at home.
@ofija_ Worked. Tastes good. I made one for the first time and with white wine. Still proud as a peacock 😂
@riigasiedzimtaa The same shit. I hate eating ibumethine (50% of which I simply puke out). So I always put off eating pills, hoping that it will go away... 😂‍♀️
Several families in Līvāni receive a gift – tomato plants More details: https://t.co/VqpHavMuBH https://t.co/Elll1y5ySY
I'll never eat a Mexican taco again.
For the first time, we had a taste of Allažu ķimelis. I must say, I don't love liqueurs, but this one is good. https://t.co/bQs0Ks90bU
Somehow interesting. The hospitality sector is one of the few where envelope wages are the most common. Well they want to cut VAT. Then construction is also within the candidates? Then, because they reduced VAT on vegetables and fruit specific to Latvia, they became more expensive for the end consumer. This experience is not enough?
@Laumaryn @_skabarga When I lived alone I never had anything at home either, except oat flakes, salt, sugar and tea and I'm a “cook”. Everything correct. :D
In the past, grandma used to bring sweets and symbolic gifts to me and my cousins for Christmas. One year Liene got long white wedding gloves (and she got married a couple of years later), but I got a grater. Thank you, grandma.
@DzeneDace I treated myself with Italian chocolate ice cream so that nerves are calmer during the pandemic :)
A day when the brain has too many additional things to process. I find out that my girlfriend's having a 3rd baby, of course, fun and at least something positive. After that some acquaintance lost the battle with cancer. And finally, my son's adventures in looking for “new flavors” by eating a ball.
@_skabarga @naurisk_ @Laumaryn I remember that mussel stuff, yes, it might not really be (in my opinion) a non-recipe, but this, come on, is as basic as it gets :D mby the difference really is in lifestyle/stage :) when I live alone/I was younger, my non-recipe was the wolt-types, wine and tomato sauce in the fridge
@laumaryn @naurisk_ I also tend to remember things and link them to today. Because mussels and canned tomato soup are so related.
@Elina_EK @_skabarga @elina_shh Among the soy and other plant-based milks, I thought the most akin to regular milk in terms of taste was hemp milk. I don't drink milk on its own - with coffee, porridge. But I like soy milk best. :)
@AnnijaGreka @elinakursite @Meibija @DagnijaNeimane I Eat humble cutouts. Rarely has anyone of the defenders of this post-soviet catering ever cooked them!
@Antuanete @chirkainaisLV @elinakursite I agree, Americans have a special relationship with meat. Which also unwittingly answers the question “where & ^ #% $ did all the bison go?” ;)
@Vinotava @Meibija @DagnijaNeimane @elinakursite A pile of fresh vegetables means that no sour cream, which is so deer to Latvians, has not been poured on top of the vegetables, and a person can choose for themselves how much/whether vinegar, olive oil, salad sauce, etc.
@Snowtales @Krista_Baumane @and_kse @io7246 @Meibija @elinakursite @DagnijaNeimane Unfortunately the post-soviet eating culture has lingered. Sausage in olivier salad, sausage in solyanka, cheese on chicken chop.... Throw on a plate whatever kind, throw in some vegetable pieces... Besides, it's not a lonely diner on the roadside, but one which “everybody likes” and must be put on IG.

We will end the tour in the museum area. Here you can rest your legs, eat, and look at the history of the development of the city of Valmiera at Hanza's buildings. By the way, there were only 310 inhabitants and 1 street in Valmiera in 1782. There were 18 streets and 2410 residents in 1881. 19/n https://t.co/lQdvAdRSU3

@cepum_s If you don't eat 4 asparagus pieces arranged in a cross and don't call a chef in delight, you don't know how to live 🤣 and if you fly with Airbaltic YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING FROM QUALITY!!!! By the way, @Vinotava , asparagus is a bigger piece of crap than the salad leaf from Kūriņš, on which a warm sauce has been poured. #trololololoooo
@aaboliiga1 before we write you off, try buying and making at home in a marinade from things you like
reasons, why not to be with me 3; 8. I don't wear pants at all( house pants don’t count) 14. I can’t draw 15. My favorite animals are pigs cows and bears 16. I don’t like to smoke,drink 17. I ate bare rice at school for lunch 18. I'd like to have 3 children
@and_kse @EsEsmuTuEsmuEs Wait, do I correctly understand that what matters to her is how the food looks and how fancy it is, not how much the medic gets to eat from it? IMO from those fancy, excuse me, pieces of crap in paper you can't fully eat.
@RozeIeva @Krista_Baumane @IngmarsLadigs A cook is meant to understand what to cut and what not to cut, which size mushrooms to put in a sauce, which in a soup. Pour sauce on top or on the side. What shape and size plate is suitable.
@krizdabz @aigarius You know what would be cool? When something turned off that time and suddenly didn't charge, you could get notified through an application on the telephone about it... or sms, for example, when the charging device itself realizes that it is no longer charging. So that it's not that you have lunch somewhere, and in the end you realize that it didn't charge...
@agnijagrigule I had a rather noticeable additional taste of that tap water at home, at one point I had that filter pot or whatchamacallit, it helped, but it broke, and I was buying bottles again. now in England I am drinking tap water, although my apartment mates are appalled that it tastes like soil, but I don't feel anything of the kind 😂 😂
We made interesting and unusual dessert plates from the ash 🤩 3 sizes(in diameter) are available: • 12 cm • 15 cm • 18 cm If you want to eat a delicious cake from a wonderful hand-made, ecological wooden dish, contact us… https://t.co/onZUO4gv3o
@ArtursL @EsEsmuTuEsmuEs It must become generic name, circa “Rollton a la Lonton”! In the future, I'll always disguise all my kitchen mistakes and turn them into an effect. “No, it's not a burnt potato mess, it's a stew in Lonton's style”! Did you hear @Mara_ar_putniem ?
Hello, @Sadalestikls ! If there is not a secret, why did electricity go out in Dobele county today? We were in a diner, but we didn't have time to eat.
@_liiga Probably, because it tastes like rubber
@cepum_s I am eating a remnant of Soviet gastronomy for the second day - a solyanka-type soup! Have to go warm up some more :D
@valerijssturis @mkKilups In the links on Delfi various mushrooms are described. See this picture https://t.co/uCeNlCmOBR
@HienaNeija @Vinotava @Meibija @Egitazz @elinakursite @DagnijaNeimane Well here are really the fine experts. Damn it, that’s some feast to keep a man from putting down a stick. And even if is tasty then what else? You can't see the ground from high shelves.
@debes_manna I’m holding on, diligently holding on. At the moment cooking and looking at the cooking lessons. Skipping very well and not listening to that nonsense at all. But still. Exhausting.
✾ mix: cottage cheese ~200+g oil ≤100ml milk ≤100ml ✾ add sugar, salt +other spices/supplements, as needed, ✾ add flour in portions ~400g & baking powder ✾ mix the dough cooled for half an hour in a refrigerator ✾ roll the dough, bake the flatbread, buns, etc. ~180°
@lambruscoweet I don't eat pork chop. :)
- Your first four men were poisoned with mushrooms, and the fifth fell down the stairs. How will you explain it? - The Fifth didn't like the taste of the mushrooms
@elinakursite Traditionally you eat this bare
@Beibleids @maris_74 You need to look at how much electricity is being consumed, but I've eaten smoked salmon there, etc, brilliant
@koshi_peleeks @maljorka @mairitaluse Yes!! For mine the muffin shapes are also going great! Sometimes even at the table they want to put everything in and just eat 😅
@IevaSt @elinakursite @janksb @Meibija @DagnijaNeimane Quality food and ribbons are two unrelated things. It thrives, and quickly specifically at the expense of poor food.
@io7246 @Vinotava @Meibija @elinakursite @DagnijaNeimane It's about being exaggerated. You don't even need to be a snob to realise that it’s brutally thrown in a bowl so much that for 2 people it would be hard to eat
@IevaSt @elinakursite @janksb @Meibija @DagnijaNeimane In what people eat in public catering, processed food there are so many poor quality and questionable ingredients that at home are deemed to be garbage or even not have a clue what the composition of it is.
tea overdose is a real thing?
@GaumigsJoks @E_Stendzenieks @TautasLaiks That's supposedly normal. The addicts slowly slowly are losing the meaning of life. It usually happens. You see, now they're going around animal farms, in one they eat marmots, ostriches in the other, they’ll eat fish or strawberries tomorrow. :) (the baby is making a roll of advertising for a let-down small town)
@UgisB Carnivores also need to eat
The cookie dough is awfully tasty.
today, I ate a borscht and talked bad about Mārcis with the wife of the baptist pastor. the guy announced in a sermon that there is only one Perfect man in the congregation and that is he himself :D also there needs to be the same number of men and women in the congregation, because that is the Will of God
Who would have thought - it turns out, not everyone likes their own medicine...
@DvinuMamma @KristZii Also olivier salad - if sliced delicately, the flavors tighten much better. I can't bear those big bites of potatoes and carrots. On the other hand, when it comes to leaf, etc. fresh vegetable salads - I completely agree.
Everything would good if the State had supported the economy instead of borrowing money to eat it down. We'll eat the money by the New Year and then a surprise will await ;)
Looking at snacky Zane's instagram when you can't eat dairy products is excruciating.
@oskarsvizbulis @VLejniece When it grew up, it lived in a enclosure in the garden; jumped over a fence to the neighbors and ate their strawberries...
https://t.co/8wt759FzmV tch?v=yl4V7ZrTPUU Pēteris Kļava at his own level. Something can be agreed with, something not, but it's something to think about when drinking tea.
@Zuzzzeee You don't even need to boil the dumplings? :D Sorry about the interrogation.
PRESS ❤, IF YOU FIND IT TASTY, HOW MANY LIKES CAN WE GET FOR THIS POST? https://t.co/OOJ1l5nJmP
@IslandeMamma @nenormamma Make them potato sandwiches with onions 🤣
@IslandeMamma Sounds extreme but tastes really good. I suggest.
@IslandeMamma To be honest, my spring salads since childhood have been picked simple leaf salads, cucumber, radish, chives and sour cream. You can add some horseradish. There. New potatoes with dill and a slice of pork chop and you know my childhood's greatest happiness ;) and salt a bit too much!
@ievagai @Anete_etenA By the way, mayonnaise with ketchup (50/50) is called kokteilsósa and can be bought in any store. Great with fries and hamburgers.
@h_punkts Does that mean we have lunch together ? 😁 🙈 And yes, that cake is simply so FANTASTIC, but since my colleague’s name is Inese I got it for congratulating 😁 Well then bon appetite to you for every time we were dining together 🤝🏻😁 About that freedom, yeah, not yet 😁
Dear table cultural apologists, teach me how to behave! If I take a beer as a beverage with the main dish, but I haven't finished it and kept it on the table until dessert, where a cake and coffee is served, then what do I do with these two drinks?
@v5_c4 Depends on the day. But often really at the same time. About the cake - I believe it! I like these too. Then bon appetite to you too! 🙂
In one word, I've discovered a new keto America. Fried radishes taste almost like fried potatoes. I almost want to say they’re more delicious. https://t.co/RMh6Co8ymj
@elinakursite I thought that fenfelis no.. but there the tastes mix and really good :) come to eat sometime at my place 😉
@Liene86806915 @UgisB But I saw barely born or even yet unhatched crow baby corpses falling from a tree. Nothing to it, somehow I keep on living and haven't stopped eating chicken eggs.
@_skabarga Very, very tasty 👍
The Wolf looked into the basket and realized he was going to eat Little Red Riding Hood, sorry - miss Goldblum's! fried sorrel pie. It's a shame there's no kefir at home...
@tofikblogs @tvitermaniaks celiac disease from birth, pollen allergies and also if I'm stressed I can get an allergic reaction from any food product. once almost kicked the bucket due to almond nuts, now I can eat them again 💁‍♀️ ‍ ️
@Vents_Zvaigzne How does asparagus taste?
@elina_shh I wasn't in Lisbon, but I was in both Faro and Porto, and Doro Valley. Portugal is the place to go. I was there for 2.5 weeks and enjoyed it very much. People are kind, food is delicious and vinho verde is refreshing.
I've said three (3) swear words in all my lifetime haha pls don't judge me from this 😆 👍
@SievieteR All sellers wanted to pack everything nicely. The husband mistook the salads in a container for cake in the morning. 😂 😂 😂
I've been sleeping during lunch time every weekday since March. Both the job capabilities are improving, and the mood. Maybe I should move to Spain? I’ll have siestas, I'll be able to keep sleeping for lunch, even not in a state of emergency. 😄
I was given strawberries that smell and taste like strawberries. Mmmmmmm...
@Vents_Zvaigzne @JanaSima @kulervo @liana_langa @Ruta_Mezavilka where’s the absurd? In the restaurant, food should be given instead of screwing with people about their beliefs. Then, in another restaurant, the owner of that restaurant can be left without food due to his outings?
darida is a simply king shit, not only top mineral water, but also cream soda and ice tea and all cheap af. Plus mf design!! https://t.co/OPe4aS5kV1
@klavs_asmanis mmmm... no, somehow no. in my hands they wouldn't be expected to come on bread. I eat everything with bread, but I folded these down while standing beside the stove, without bread, so to say, without leaving the cash register. later I just had to drink a beer.
@Farming_Bear @_angelicmou Omg I need that short and pants

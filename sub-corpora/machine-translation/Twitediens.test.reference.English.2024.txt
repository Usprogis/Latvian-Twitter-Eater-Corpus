@ElitaKazaine @tvitermaniaks @atheist_from_lv must look somewhere at Popokatepetl’s for some Tomato Words, won't be in parents' dowry :( and some ritual for the Summoning Dance of the Bushy Bunch
@maljorka Hehe, I prefer without anything then, not like this. :D Ah, tastes are so different.
@IngaStirna Apple charlotte.
We were at Grandma’s today (firewood + things to bring). I expected that it would get better, and I would miss her less, but we could only talk to her through the window and we ate buns in the car instead of having lunch. Not ok.
@DigiPapucis @LLauliba To be honest around 50% of the time I feel like that guy from @LLauliba. E.g. “Oh, the horror, kids have smeared something because he didn't look”, “The kids were eating flakes for breakfast” is my every day now. And overall, everything is fine. Slightly annoyed by the norms of how every parent should behave, especially NOW
@E_Stendzenieks “So have you eaten or not? If you have not eaten, what should I make for you, put your ass on the floor"
Mushrooms can also be picked in spring and in a young stand, and they are not poisonous if you know how to cook, we eat them since childhood! https://t.co/heGv5ENR7W
Attention! Important news in my life 1. I am finally eating cold soup 2. The cold soup was blue https://t.co/CijIXDZKuy
@INiedzviedze @WilmaLinda To be honest, I liked school lunch very much. My mother was offended when I told her that the meatball was as tasty as it was at school 
@WilmaLinda In childhood, one aunt showed a recipe - mix margarine with grated cheese and tomato sauce, smear on white bread, a fresh cucumber on top. Jesus, even now I started drooling. And I will never understand any fried fish and the phenomenon of fish or milk soups.
@Uckevics @maljorka It's not about being able to bite a carrot, eat an apple or a tomato. But adding simply chopped vegetables to the portion without an additive is not tasteful. Besides, vegetables without additives are not a salad. In winter, pile up sliced Chinese cabbage and a couple of tomato slices. What is this?
@MrBalins @WilmaLinda celery with chocolate and @shmaramagda
@RaivisDejus @edaliba Not eating meat is a very irrational act because you're forced to eat physically larger volumes, resulting in more of your valuable life span being wasted in such a senseless thing as eating.
@WilmaLinda I very much like dressed herring, just without herring.
@WilmaLinda Milk vegetable soup when the new potatoes, and other vegetables appear.
@WilmaLinda Sorrel soup is my favorite soup! But in general, such normal dishes are listed in the comments. :) I wonder what's strange that I'm eating - do green, freshly peeled potatoes count? Tastes good :) Oh, and I like all the offal, starting with liver and ending with bull's balls :D
I know it's stylish to say that when you eat fish or chicken, you're practicing some kind of vegetarianism, but don't be an idiot, and stop it. You're very much disturbing the people who don't eat meat, since because you omnivores think that a vegetarian = eating only a few types of meat/a picky eater.
@DGFelton @sencis_ @Vinkele Of course. If Ramona were there, the defenders of Ilze would eat her up off with all her belongings. That's exactly why it amuses me.
@IvarsNeiders By the way that impossible burger and beyond meat - a really interesting product. There is one third company in Latvia only, but even they are already very delicious. I recommend that the OLearys in Akropole, they have such a burger. Made of plants, but tastes super
@mairitagurova The taxi driver was introduced through acquaintances of acquaintances. We walked everything on foot. We got tired. Then we got free cakes and burgers. We protested, of course, but he told us that Valmiera people were hospitable folk. Your tour reminded of how lovely it is on that side.
@selmuushh Everything normal, I like a cheese sandwich with caramel sauce, I don't regret anything.
@sankuperis Well, at least while eating you can remove the mask

In the United States, GABA can be purchased as a food supplement without rx. I bought 200caps at Walmart for 7$. I eat one, interesting feeling, because after 15 minutes there was an abnormal sour taste in my mouth. I remembered acid stimulation and pharmacology. Anxiety was induced more than suppressed. Bottle in the trash can, bye.
People like to live in Latvia because there is nature here, relatives, friends, but one must also eat and earn: @ssemjonovs @RIGATV24 #presesklubs
coffee and a cigarette best breakfast and u cant tell me otherwise
@elinakursite To make spaghetti with minced meat. Over time, I have perfected the recipe, and now I am making the Bologna sauce in my own way. But it's still one of my favorite dishes. :)
@taekooknina Chocolate cake/tart 
@TInzenieris you just don't know how to. and overall, in Soviet times sausage was made from real meat and everyone had a place to live :D
The hardest thing at work are the last 7 hours. You already drank coffee, now sit, wait for when it's OK to go home.
@selmuushh I'm eating pancakes with cheese and strawberry or raspberry jam. The best composition! It's not normal, so I’m told.
@vaivarei @IvetaKazoka A person who is currently doing this was overwhelmingly removed from even the few who voted for the party of the Minister of Health, but is now deciding what to do and how to do it...So- you better not bother yourself with thinking! Better to drink some schnapps and eat meatballs not philosophize about health.
@krisselerts @davissuneps I've had the last big shock of beer prices was when Kinfield (RIP of course) in a Valmiermuiža bottle went for €5. Which might be OK in an upscale place, but there the food cost 6-7. 
There was a scandal in the morning with “I can't stand it anymore, I'm going to kindergarten” (oh, I recognize myself). At lunchtime we're already playing coffee shop, and the five-year-old is making lunch. The melted cheese triangle in the middle of the pizza is a #zerowaste decor, because “no one will eat one, I'll decorate it here”. https://t.co/TAztzutnDF
@alise_bi Yeah, shouldn't have - the survey was set up biased, with a hint. The results already show that the number of top and bottom cheese placers is the same, but the real reason for choosing a constructive scheme is impossible to determine. Just as “helps contain”, as it tastes better or looks lovely.

@DvinuMamma How lucky I was at the moment my child learned to breastfeed (1.5 months). I enjoyed feeding from the bottle and then breast + milking. As a matter of principle, all you do it feeding or milking and washing all the gadgets. Hallelujah it is over.
@MatissJekabsons It would be ok if you exported the goods or you had an online shop. Then perhaps bilingualism should have been introduced? Who knows somebody will mix up cream with milk.
@realGints @Tas_es_Pats @skatsnokoka Ticks. One got in my ear and bit it. Yesterday I just read about flaviviruses. But at least there are no (for now) south-specific mosquitoes with the viruses they carry. (Off-topic)
Does anyone know anyone from the Bolderaja manufacturer's “Buschman (or somehow) Tools”? They work with the metal, for export. And here we need one of their manufactured tools almost as much as food...
@labina2kurpe Homeless or a piece of meat - that's still a question.
@zaledaya Grow back your hair, they said. Eating your hair like spices with each meal, they said.
@rubinstein_ And actually - “the most wonderful time of the year” is about the time when you can eat cold soup again. Long live the jar-pickled beetroot!
@ELisovskis The thoughts of coherence depend on customs in each family individually. In one it is gladly eaten, in another it is rejected, because “I don't eat this”. I think that having a real sense of hunger it would be eaten without any objection.
@IneseEjugbo @HenrietaVerho Done. Such a tasty subject for my brother. Cheers!
@and_kse @selmuushh I think that the mistake is in strawberry jam. Russian with raspberry jam *is* yummy
THE PINK MOUNTAINS When mother earth cooked pink semolina, she was waiting for the sky father in her house. This mother's dinner was so tasty that father took it with him to heaven. And all the clouds that ate the semolina turned to miraculous pink hills. https://t.co/P9Mgi79TRY

@Eriks_the_Great There's that fancy word - feeling. :) The food is good, the hosts are great, but the view of the lake is not interchangeable with anything. Today there were a lot of cars, people are not in a hurry to leave, going for a walk, everyone has enough space. The hostess is exhausted. :)
@svartkvit @Dzherijs Would you entrust him to pick mushrooms? :)
@VinetaPu Stew - fry onions in a pot, add potatoes and pour over a glass of broth. Add tomatoes in their juice and Turkish peas. Add some broccoli, mushrooms, zucchini, or whatever your heart desires.
@ritaignate @ArvisKolmanis There are types of bread where there is no added sugar or malt - you certainly must have some there. And you can bake quick bread at home too. I am not using any added sugar for half of a year, I thought it is easy, just need to think along.
on the beach, a gang of five married-age young people wanted to take a picture in the hammock where I was sitting with children. I offered to lick the spoon with which we ate lunch. they got offended and said I was in violation of all the rules.
@spigana Tastes like pancakes. The texture is nice. If you make too thin, then a little underwhelming.

@jabuslemts I get gastritis in the period when I was eating healthier than ever. But the stress and muscle that doesn't close the stomach completely and the acid goes in the esophagus + you can't lie down or bend over after eating, the same thing.

@NeilaKrave @karlis_arajs I don't believe that you haven't met a vegetarian at a party who, instead of quietly eating bread with cheese, salad, dessert, begins to lecture on animal rights. It has also occurred that in a communal kitchen with one refrigerator, vegetarians have objections that others keep products there too.
And what did you do today? I ate a cheese dessert with a three day old expiration date.
It's a very, very, very bad day today. I didn't sleep at all at night, and in the day I was shivering and crying. My eyes are hurting. Sleep is important. Eating is important. Fluid is important. Movement in fresh air is important. All of this affects mental health.

@MatissJekabsons I have a bulimia, so eating correctly is how it is... I'm trying. Have tried cardio outside, but I haven't really been succeeding ever since moving to near Riga. It's not that the gym is compulsory. But I like to have a routine every day that doesn't depend on anything... 
Diploma thesis: I hate that Hesburer™️ raises prices and does not train employees, and that is why there is shitty service, error in order performance, and overall the new potato shape is shit and oil is everywhere (EVERYWHERE) tastes like it was a week old.

I bought a bun, and I thought I'd eat on the bus - I didn't have breakfast today. I waited for the bus to arrive, put on a mask, pulled out the bun, broke my brain.

@btsjams321 but at least coffee is always with me and never fails me when I do my homework at three o'clock in the night
@kkriistaaaaa coffee gives black circles under your eyes and caffeine addiction
@btsjams321 if but coffee in excellent
@liana_langa @ZiemasEzis @AnitaDreika @XforY Sure everyone translates differently. My version is a mix up at the very beginning when Baiba bites to realize that it's not Zane and falls in love at the first sight! And of course it is a big spite that the first boy in the village doesn't get the girl he wants.
@bemusha Ya tasty, and I do not mess up much, following the instructions and the complexity is very appropriate for me:) Only the miniature moments - I had too many and too large strawberries, it would look better visually with smaller or cut ones. Next time ^^
@_evija And some dishes taste better if you eat them with your fingers.
Happy birthday to Rihards Gorks. A multitasker who cooks meat on hashtags and reads instastories to his daughters. Cheers!
Cechist, blissed at his successful tweet in his opinion, polished his patent leather shoes and Lenin's badge, tied the red muffler around his fat neck from eating sunflower seeds and donuts, and goes out on the sidewalk to spit on the ground.
Sometimes I'm so annoyed by my problem of not being able to eat the last bite of food because I don't want to / it doesn't fit. There's a little left, but no, it won't happen! So thank you  to all my watch pigs.
I'm sitting in a cardboard box right now and eating grapes
@koszmarek_LV it was 20 years back, then countrymen hadn't gone through the bitter schools of life yet. The children of screamers of that time are now picking Irish mushrooms.
@LusisToms @GMeluskans @Palkavnieks Depends also on the Olivier salad and soup, beetroot-water-based soup doesn't go with sausage, in white kefir soup goes very well, even in the red beetroot Olivier salad doesn't go well, while with the white one it is very ok.
@hmm_pff @Oysterreich oh my. I see this Russian in his future life wearing a linen shirt braids garters decorated with swastikas eats cumin cheese and makes puzurs. take that Russian - one zero for the benefit of nationalism!
Not that I'm complaining, but I was waiting for a time when I can have breakfast like this. Self smoked meat and all the greens fresh from my own garden 
About face masks- we have to polish floors. Are they available somewhere now, or do we really have to eat the paint dust?
@VilksTavsBiedrs It is applicable to farmhouses. My relative, in the name of old love, ran to the love of his youth. There you have it, she now needed not just to have breakfast together, but also building a chicken coop, mowing grass, building a fence, but the rest of it there was no longer enough health
well and here i am. eating breakfast at fkn 11 with dirty hair
Good is that morning when Karums awaits in the closet and today putting on the blue outfit with @sauc_mani earrings. 
@latviangrey Chocolate in combination with anything sour. Cherries/strawberries/any berries in chocolates etc. In restaurants, the disappointing desserts are “Valron chocolate fondant... with cherry sauce darn.”
@latviangrey @Reinis_Me I mostly eat in the evenings
@Kilkuts Ventspils market. On Saturdays. White-and-blue striped awning. Brilliant chicken and pork galerts.
@WilmaLinda Breakfast flakes with apple juice :D
I found a video with a visitor to "Kūriņš" who refused to eat without a Colorado tape. I translated: - who are you? WHO ARE YOU, to tell me... TO tell ME, a real local patriot, what do I do??? Many individuals have multiplied here, who can't say anything in my language... #9May
@JeteBurkanciema @jtaurens I don't remember that combination. I remember boiled fish with boiled cabbage - it was horrible, but that didn't reduce my desire to eat cabbage or fish.
@HairsprayQ My culinary flight occasionally goes up to cheese salad baskets. But I must admit that I'm buying salads prepared and baskets too, and I just put the salad in them, respectively.
@arturscukurs So I walked to the same shed opposite the cinema Gaisma, pulled out a pack of hundred rubles, peeled exactly one ruble from that stack, bought ice cream for twenty kopecks, got the change, stuffed it back into my pocket, happily collected my ice cream and walked back through the Vecpuiši park.
@elinakursite @Kilkuts Probably those who can't cook/haven't eaten good galert or just don't eat meat.
@my_rita I think the sales lady at the meat shop remembers me as a freak. I bought meat on a regular basis, sometimes this, sometimes that. I once bought sausages and asked how they should be cooked. I thought she was going to get a heart attack 
Not that I'm complaining, but the new vekeburger in Hesburger is a very good meatless option for the appropriate price (80 cents)! i usually get one burger and one big burger set to get two burgers!
@kasparslicitis @Dzintris But food is tasty and at affordable prices... that's why it's already full.
@ancetarvida @briedisunrepshe what ? he mean it literally that by eating mushrooms, the computer would start producing visualizations physically on his behalf, but had thought that as subtext? And my suggestion, if the computer starts drawing visualizations physically, to eat LSD was a waste of time... ;(
The first strawberries grown in the "Ar B Agro" farm of Seme parish of Tukums county, tasted by @sandradiezina. On Friday, strawberries cost €12/kg. https://t.co/TRFTxUNfpq
@briedisunrepshe @ancetarvida @EsEsmuTuEsmuEs better eat LSD, but only with someone who has used it before...
okey, but like, since when do I like buckwheat?
@WilmaLinda Meatballs with an onion and mint tea
how can you like the ordinary dynamite? it tastes like metal
Chinese super doctor Ansi Zedun says that the best tea against cough Covid-19 and corruption is cowslip tea! https://t.co/NMfB4dM2A4
@WilmaLinda Potato dumpling milk soup. A green cucumber with honey.
The first lead was caught out! If you like it so much, we arranged it again. Cheers! 
@WilmaLinda White bread with sour cream and little bit salt. Onions and garlic are chopped, mixed with mayonnaise and black pepper and on dark bread. Freshly pressed juice from 2 apples, 2 lemons and big ginger root - an outstanding drink, which can only be consumed by rare people and no-one likes 
coffee and cigarette and fa... this time only a fart in my pants 
GALERT!!!!!!!!!! https://t.co/kxHGbDLTQw
@NeilaKrave @vaiarine @karlis_arajs If the body is not predisposed to it, an expensive pleasure! For me not to eat meat I would need some 5 avocados and at least 300 g almonds per day.
@WilmaLinda I reallly, so really like white bread + butter + honey it's the taste of my childhood 
@AndzejMic @WilmaLinda Oh ya, this is mine too. I usually wonder when someone tastes it and doesn't express delight.
1920 - I send you my latest verses for a critical glimpse. - Oh, my dear... If you knew with what pride I read your poetry this morning in front of a small group of breakfast eaters on the outside terrace. Verses fabulous, language - talented. 2020 - Did you listen to the piece? - Yep :)
@WilmaLinda I mix kefir with tomato juice and salt in a half-liter cup.
@elitaveidemane @VRudzitis Somehow those sirens of technocracy eat souls
Do you also call the crab salad “crabers”?
@_evija Rapeseed ice cream 
@AndraKaupe @vaiarine @karlis_arajs Do you think that not eating meat is “normal” only if you don't like it or health doesn't allow?
Homies demand chops.😍❤ Oh my, I'm so tired of that cooking! 🥴🙄
@knipinska I thought they'd eat that poor person. Well, nature is ruthless and these live shows give a good insight.
There is work, dangerous work and work in Ireland in meat processing during the pandemic. https://t.co/ji8aO6COzT
Pour the mass of vanilla ice cream in a bowl, refrigerate properly, then place in the freezer and mix thoroughly at least four times every 15 minutes. Do it until the mass has thickened properly Let it taste well 😋 @Spilthethea_lv
@ZiemasEzis @SPLITTERIS @SPKCentrs Walks, eats and sleeps with a mask.
- pour milk and sweet cream into a saucepan. Cut the vanilla bean lengthwise, clear the seeds and flesh: put both the scraped flesh and the pod in liquid. Stir in half of sugar, boil, remove it from the fire and let it absorb for 20 minutes.
@LieneBs Ogubāze (search for Facebook) but I saw that they raised prices a lot (I was buying a box of strawberries for 12.50, but the offer was just now 21 eur/box).
My first harvest. Yes, yes, just a salad that doesn't require special care, but pride is still great ☺ ️ Bitterness is created by the fact that someone has broken a hole in my favorite @VaidavaCeramics bowl and won't admit it, but the salad shall still be. Despite the hole! https://t.co/UunqjsEBv4

@Vents_Zvaigzne Cabbage juice needs to be packed in champagne bottles. So that there are bitterness gasses.
Good multiplies good! Mols, along with friends from the confectionery Sala and Hospiss LV, is visiting medical officers to deliver warm lunches and thank them for working all these months. Let us continue to delight our medics until May 12th, delivering 1000 meals all together. https://t.co/PllREmIP5k
@KrischaKrisch @cepum_s Oh, well then it's fully ok! We have 1x per month. I am, of course, also pleased that there is such an offer and opportunity. At this time it really eats absolutely everything and a bit more:-))
@normundsbergs Then you are proposing to cripple the free market in which the consumer himself decides to give €5 to which merchant, stipulating that the country should choose individual merchants who will deliver everyone their lunch?
@ArvisKolmanis @DzeneDace No more meat in the freezer?
@LindaLauzeL The foundation should be put in today:) The second coffee will need to be supplemented with a shot:)
@VinetaPu Every morning for breakfast - leaves, cucumber, tomato, radish, mozzarella, Turkish peas, pesto along with an omelet in all sorts of ways. While watching a movie or reading instead of something “chewable.”
@VinetaPu Put it in finely cut Greek salad, any vegetable curry or tomato-lentil soup. Surely, king Humus without a say :)
@ruslansbiserovs 8 years old, begged my mother to give me a taste of a beer, I still like the taste beer
@artis_dobrajs @GaumigsJoks @EinarsCilinskis Yes. Polonium tea is just as illogical. To accept that and Novichok there must be another factor that would give logic to everything. I hope it will be revealed someday. In the meantime, as the only factor is being proposed - Putin is a mentally ill maniac with a tendency to show off in absurd ways.
@thislifeer @meta_sniedze @KannaRagnesse How long has he been working there? The family and I (6 people) were at Forest for a holiday dinner on November 18, 2018, the food was very mediocre, not in line with the price. It wouldn't go for a second time. There are other much better restaurants in Riga. It doesn't rule out that your friend is cooking well, just experience.
It took a global crisis, a pandemic, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people to finally start covering pastries in stores
@cepum_s @LiepinLiva We have a tradition in place even before the distancing - bringing lunch boxes everywhere with us, a tea thermos and for me coffee in a thermal cup. For the kid it's an adventure, for me - more economical :D
@meta_sniedze Some Romeo, ibio... everyone knows what it ended up with.. oh whell... (Beer tastes better in Purčiks!)️☺️
@dianchuuz That's not good. You need to eat properly. You need fruit, vegetables, and meat (if you're not vegan) because the organism needs everything. Of course the organism itself knows what it needs. For example, I can not eat meat for months, but then eat it again. But if you don't eat anything then you will have no energy
@vardotaja I think there can be at least 1 more step between a favorite and a can eat.
@meta_sniedze For a moment after the birth of my child I could eat very much, so much that I didn't understand where all that food was going to. 
@ddzr_a @bobijsvelns She needs to get the right proportion. Back in my day they were making it from meat sauce powder 5 spoons for a half-glass of water, of course it would be shit. From scratch, I would try to make things this way, but I wouldn't put whiskey and sweet cream, and just reduce some beef broth. https://t.co/koKloAqUf3
I treated “throat pain” like crazy for a week and was already panicking about the virus until I realized today that my throat was burning with stomach acid. And all that now when I am finally eating more correct/better/more often than ever? How ironic! Yes, yes, stress is already at a super level. 
@_liiga Yeah, mine also get mad occasionally when terns want to eat their babies, but they successfully repel them. The cats, which hang out down by the tree, are also attacked.
I got a bitten in my hand by something and I don't feel my skin in a circle around that bite, wtf

@UllaPerkune Marinate for at least 24 h, it absorbs better, tastes better, keep it in a cool place - refrigerator, cellar. Coal - “Marienburg” one of the best, long lasting, hot, can be found in “Kurši.” Put pieces of meat close together, but not to squish.
@UllaPerkune Doesn't matter what kind of meat. The coal is very hot. Frequently flip over while frying to fry from all sides. For sauce - mayonnaise, water, kefir, tomato sauce, can be mixed. In addition: cut or grated - onions, garlic, spices. Vinegar - a little for the taste, not to exaggerate. Do not add sugar. Salt according to taste.
@miculis @realKrivenchy We should learn from Dārta and as real men drink schnapps like apple juice in gulps!!!
@SoosaarD Just start to accumulate offsprings, you will quickly learn to snooze while awake, see with your ears, hear with your skin, run in several directions, make your bed with your foot, eat faster than in the army, and become inadequate at the doctor's :)
I couldn't eat avocado bread at all this morning. I have to admit it at last - I don't like avocados. Am I going to become a boomer? Is the social network lynching going to come over my head? Am I going to make a favor of the harpsichord and Brainstorm? The future is very uncertain.
@bibaiba I was in Finland on a business trip, and when I went to dinner I suddenly met a friend who had recently moved there. I met him on his birthday in a town 120 km from his place of residence.
NUTRITION You can eat what you want if you are a growing organism, BUT you eat sweets in moderation, don't eat (rarely) “fast food”, etc. And if you want to lose weight, then don't do it with starving yourself, it can be very damaging to your organism, because the organism won't get vitamins and substances that are needed
Before the festival @Zemkopibas_min etc. called for the purchasing of food produced in Latvia. I would also add plant breeders. If someone needs tomato, cabbage plants, flowers or berries - look for the nearest plant breeder. They are not doing well right now. Markets and fairs are not happening. #atbalstisavējo !
And really, you're going to eat me ?!!!
This reminds me: Do you want stew for dinner? Children: Yeeees!!! No, not ice cream, but vegetable stew with chicken. Children: #&¥§{#+-!!!!!
@agijakola I'm very surprised at how rarely people eat stews. 
@agijakola Cabbage- carrot one I ate a week ago. Then I threw some of it into a beetroot soup the next day. On the third day added a lot of chili powder to the beetroot soup. Stew marathon. 
@S_Simplicitas @Mara_ar_putniem @tandemnieks yeah, that's true. That was if you want to eat yourself (Nan did it?)
@MammaTvito Oh, a lot of everything. Chocolate like iron, liver pate in general is the most disgusting thing in the world. All cabbage like mold.

@realKrivenchy Usually, casual folk wake up in the morning, go to the toilet, eat breakfast, watch TV, read the media, work, rest, get sick, die, get married, pick their nose, and scratch their bottom. The guards of the fatherland see it all as a battle.

@KatrinaKukuma More finely! MUCH more finely :D So that you can't bite on a piece while eating :D

@nenormamma I'm already sickened when I wash water bottles - it's being muffled even through a straw. I don't even want to talk about food being thrown in a cup eating at all... I take my breath and pour out the cup into the toilet with my eyes closed 
@LieneBrizga It depends on the person. When I made it, seven people ate.
@JankaPipars You didn't understand what I was talking about? About not eating with a fork... :) All your sarcasm, which you devote to Russia, unfortunately to the same extent can be devoted to Latvia, in which “there was no” Covid, no one died, but it was revealed that the whole funeral office was sick. Let's rather start with pulling your own log out of the eye... :)
@debes_manna Judging by the leaves, what can be seen in the pictures are some kind of cabbage family rhizomes - radishes or turnips, not parsnips, but the pleasure of working in the garden is not lessened by it in no way. :)
@bibaiba Yes, we appreciated this. Also the raspberry and blackcurrant one, which really tastes "like berries" :) But I do not understand those new squares without a stick. How do you eat them??

@bibaiba Pols also has a normal size ice cream in a waffle cup :) https://t.co/gBL047UggL
@pragsmacktics I used to eat more, but often got nausea, however it might also come from not chewing properly.
Where is the booze? Flowers are planted in wine boxes afterwards at home. :D
@HienaNeija To whom a table, to whom the entire lunch ;).
BIG FACTS!
To overeat like this !!!
@uldisz @CSDD_LV Mhm, and the ice cream also doesn't taste LIKE THAT anymore... :D But overall congratulations and let it roll well, and stop safely! :)

@MartinsAbolins Cracks already exist. When I read that in an idle allowance, some good “creative” receives as much as I get in my salary (working in the medical field in these circumstances-with a limited number of PPE, under stress, and WITHOUT any premium), I am getting sick. Meanwhile, they are baking cakes and watching sunsets at home. Fair?
@IevaSniedze Chinese eat them, don't they? What about them??
@KaivaAnna Coffee – Innocent/MiiT, and actually I also prefer Caffeine.
@LadyyWollff @guntiskalnins @GMeluskans a McDonalds burger is also not a "rea" product. I've eaten one fine veg burger in Sweden, which didn't taste like meat at all, and in my work café in Sweden also a few which were very ok. Same with falafels. Non-vegetarians also like to experiment with something new.
@baletomaanija I can't roll my tongue. It has plagued me all my childhood. I also fall into panic if I have to peel potatoes with a knife, thank God for the vegetable pealer.
@Rihards_St @GMeluskans It's a problem with the belief that all vegetarians are the same, although there are hardcore vegetarians who don't eat it, there are also ones who haven't fully refused meat or who have a desire for something that resembles meat, and then there are the posers + carnivores who sometimes try it
@ms_logina Those pastries in Rimi plastic

When moving to live in the countryside, what has been the biggest negative surprise you weren't prepared for. For me the appetite and courage for wild animals.
I hadn't been to Ēlande until now. Now we ordered a festive dinner from there. Not cheap, but generally enjoyed it.
@ultragreat1 @h_side Well, read something about the crusades! Also look at the history of Spanin (including about the reconquista), the origins of the Madrid name... Those were arguments not so much about what name to call God, but about culture, laws, banal things like meat eating, etc.

@ArtursBridaks I've had double happiness with everyone else until now for not hearing that sauce in the sentence
@TInzenieris @LVceli It would be cool to see your vision. I don't know how to deal with a crossing with Zemeņu Street, because there's a big narrowing there, and there's a great need for a pedestrian/bike path.
@Naktene @DvinuMamma You don't eat fish and any animal products - milk, eggs?
I'm making breakfast. I see a woman out the window start talking to the janitor. I thought it was nice to have a chat, probably about life! Community!Friendship! After a while I open the window, I understand that "conversation" is accusations to the janitor Ok. Somehow like that in my childhood the illusions that the world was nice were broken
@ofija_ @Naktene Meat can also be consumed by everyone. It's not a nut allergy, so it's just imaginings. Meat is on the table, well, don't eat.
@liana_langa Stems don't bother, but fresh leaves can be cut into salads - very healthy!
Breakfast 
@Driafre @ArvisKolmanis @ZPupola It's more simple. Eating a small moderately reasonable amount of bird meat a month is much easier than following a correct diet as a vegan/vegetarian. Less chance to fuck up. Another thing is that most people eat fat too large (even unhealthy) quantities of meat.
@ZPupola It's actually interesting that while eating meat myself, I've never met that mythical, aggressive vegan, but a chorus of meat eaters crying at least on soc. nets on every step.
@GunitaBa From Uzvara Park to Jaunmārupe Park about 15+15 km. There's a pretty beach to eat ice cream. Almost like in Jurmala :)
I am a Latvian, I will be a Latvian, I will always stay a Latvian. When I go to rest at the beach, I'll only eat in "Kūriņš". 
@Kaspars712 @Eraksti @AmiSkywalker Eat my ass.
@bizenajs @garamgajejs by the way, he was the first who tasted those Carnilove chips and admitted them to being tasty. 
It is 5:15, I'm drinking wine, eating cake and playing sudoku.
in the shop close to home I saw a very large pack of crisps for a euro sixty-five and bought it without thinking long. I come home, open and a big surprise - instead of sour cream and onion flavor it is dill. and needless to say that dill chips are one of my most unloved ones. 
@IvarsNeiders @J_Radins It is actually accurate. therefore the carnivore has to be certain about the origin of the meat to compare the effects of the omnivore and vegetarian.
I have vegan children sausages at home, I don't know what's going on at all
@DW_Immurs @ZPupola @ms_logina There are vegans who do it for the freedom of the mind and body, and they have a problem with the volume of Sodium in fake meat, which on the one hand is right, too much is not good, and one should look at how much is there. There are also those who think that vegans can't find meat to be tasty. That's a bit more stupid.

@frakcija @lastguru_net That they do not support. It's not beneficial for them that people eat healthy and live long. Too much pension to pay.
@DvinuMamma On-the-spot cooked herring ice cream is served on freshly beat and flame-heated egg white. I must say, it was Estonians. There at the moment the so-called Nordic fusion is in fashion.
@Naktene My dog gets fresh meat only from the hunt and then, artiodactyl or neighboring lamb. I don't believe raw meat on the market...
@atheist_from_lv I've never cooked meat dishes in my life. If I tried to cook, it would probably be, first of all, vomited all over, second, unenjoyable. If friends want meat or alcohol, they bring it to me themselves. I do not impose anything on anyone.
@atheist_from_lv Because it would be unkind to guests? Omnivores usually eat carrots and peas, but vegetarians don't eat chicken hearts. In other words, it would not matter for some, but for others a blow of the hammer on their necks. Therefore, perhaps you should not, if you respect the ones you invite over.
@GMeluskans Well good morning :D people choose not to eat meat for ethical reasons. Even if they like the taste
the next time vegans visit me, I'll prepare a carrot-pea stew, but chicken hearts instead of carrots, stomachs instead of peas. Well all is chill, if you can substitute meat in a cutlet with a soy, why not the other way around?
@ArvisKolmanis @GMeluskans Btw, I don't hate that people eat meat — I understand, they're used to it —, but, for example, tofu lets you expand the horizon. In the end, in Asian cuisine, especially Japanese, it appears quite a lot.
@reallygayTM2 for breakfast ganja + Gin and tonic. for dinner cottage cheese with radishes and cucumber
@gerda_c If you don't count tea picking, then selling beer and snacks in big concerts (Elton John, Depeche Mode, etc.). The unused barrels remained for us. We poured in the empty bottles of lemonade from the trash .. It was a good time :D
@gerda_c But my first favorite job was in the summer when I was 15 and I was selling ice cream at Vecāķi Beach. That was the life. I was selling it right at the station, people were there only when the trains came, in the remaining time I was reading books (circa one per day), and eating a lot of ice cream.
@depresivakuce I think of other people as pieces of cake when I say, “i'd like a piece of that cake” lmao
@Eriks_the_Great @Ingridaa_S @ArvisKolmanis @VRudzitis Then don't bother. The measure of your values is bloody pieces of meat with which you are showing off publicly? I, for example, don't care about them.
What does cardboard taste like. And all that is in the wrong century.
I like orange juice, but I'll never drink it by itself
@bobijsvelns I like elvis or festivalburgers
I ate a McDonald's in honor of Latvia's independence
One family's children - one wants dumplings for dinner, the other - steamed vegetables!
I've got some kind of housewife channel opening up. Potato scones with cheese and chicken chops tonight.
Tried strawberry-rhubarb crumble today at the suggestion of @dacegrr, it vanished faster than ever! Mega good. ^_^ And others typed their recipes at my tweet, now I have where to draw inspiration.
@Egitazz @DobelesDzirnavn Maybe try with other rice.
I want to eat strawberries on a summer evening so that it sounds like a song.
@krizdabz comfort? not that when you make coffee in a normal espresso machine, you have to plow 20 beetroot furrows in parallel, darnit.
@krizdabz You can give a standing ovation for this invention. Coffee EUR 10 kg + pile of plastic waste for EUR 50 kg. (well approximately that proportion). Something is wrong with our society in general. A normal coffee machine pays off in couple of kg!
half a minutes time. When ready, PUT ON YOUR GLOVE (your fingers will still be useful) and pull it out. As it cools down, make coffee, pile the pastries on the plate, and bring it to the bed with such a face as it would have been easy. Please dear women, enjoy it! Your job is to stay in bed and not disturb.
@KristineStend @ArvisKolmanis The Communist will sin if he eats a pig snout or grey peas.
@kasparszellis After that we celebrated in my house with friends all night. We drank VanaTallinn(for Baltic unity! 
I: Darn, I need to start eating less, or I'm gaining weight. Everyone around me: you're skinny either way. My brother later sees me eating the uncountable time: No, you really need to stop eating so much. At the same time, I: Oh, I'll bake some pastries today. 
@IlzeJaunberga Bad PR for dandelions 
@Kristap_s I will look forward ;) It was a pleasure to meet you "live" :) Let it taste well :)
@ArvisKolmanis You have to combine lunch, breakfast and dinner in one meal!☝
Are you also getting calls from your mom early in the morning and congratulations on the day of the year of independence of Latvia? Prosecco and cakes in red-and-white tones are likely to be missed out on this year.
I'm going to steal chocolate from the pantry!! thank you co-star!!! https://t.co/H6rWW9pJgz
In elementary school, if I'm not mistaken, around third grade, the teacher allowed us to eat sweets during the lesson, because it was her Birthday. It was a literature lesson, in which I was asked to read, but I couldn't because I was busy with ice cream.
@ritaignate In the middle of this interview about why wormwood tea helps https://t.co/vcxTNZhtfU
That scent! I very much hope that coffee will help with waking up and starting the day. https://t.co/68lVZWrbza
To ask for a piece of cake?
@ritaignate @KasparsFunts There is no need for sugar in sourdough bread. For coffee (good) also no. Even milk already seems to be a desecration of good coffee. But it's hard to bake roll biscuit without sugar. I put honey in pancakes (dissolved in warm milk). If sweets are made at home... then laziness ideally reduces sugar consumption.
@ritaignate @PandaElijah And what's the point of refusing products with added sugar but eating apples in large volumes that have sugar?
@_evija Absolutely agree. And isn't it that these fantastic feelings are being suppressed by perfectionists who have to eat everything from the same plates? 
@pelnins @regejss absinthe is similar but there is at least 50 %! tastes like licorice
Smthn didn't go well there with filming. And that food had to be stored in the cellar for about 3 days. When he finally managed to consume it, the food had been become somehow weak. It seems like, I felt or read from the actors, he he. I respect such revelations. #pusnaktsmurdziņi I hope I didn't dream this

@RuditeV With endless work, fatigue. Mom at the hospital, husband also got sick. The immediate work is on fire, but need to prepare pastries for the bridge guards. To the hospital. In the evenings, have to walk around apartments of Ķengarags agitating for election. Russians, Russians, Russians. Oh God, how many of them!
Could a white wine with orange juice be called Vinosa? I haven't posted any instastory for 5 days. I usually put up to 10 a day. All sorts of random stuff. Texture, perspective, cat, mood, inspiration, taste, scent. A hangover started today. Come on, chérie, come on.

@LieneBrizga And especially growing children! Who move! I sympathized with the families with teenagers! Milk! Eggs! Bread! How quickly can you eat out the entire pantry!!!!
@pragsmacktics I hate disordered store shelves. I can't walk by if someone drops canned peas on the pasta shelf. Must be put in place. Or crookedly placed products. If tea packages are not neatly in line or juice packs are standing in a chaotic way.. If I get to hell, it will look like Rimi in late evenings.
@AValdbergs @AnsisPupols @Sarmite_Kolate Some here have become lazy! A proper Latvian boils groats and eats with herring. It's just the same as sushi, just without all the poking around with bamboo tools. The squinting eyes don't know how to make a proper spoon from linden. They don't even know in brine barrels - call it soy sauce and spill around on the table
Daughter is eating breakfast and suddenly out of nowhere: "Dad has the biggest cheeks of us all! " It must be noted that both Dad and his cheeks are slender. 
Yes. Birds are also in desperation. I sat on a bench in the empty Old Riga to eat ice cream. There, a totally fearless and well-organised sparrow group almost beat me up and tried to take it away. I barely protected it.
Especially tasty with the first greens! Whole milk cottage cheese "Limbažu piens" for a spring price in LaTS stores! https://t.co/s0fhBY9R3W
@anita_muizniece Better to pull the little fresh leaves + flowers. More delicious, an interesting sour-sweet taste. The fresh leaves can be eaten just like that at the same time - delicious!
@bebitsvaig My GP told me that kids are mood eaters too. There are days when they barely eat anything and days when they eat like a lumberjack. And everything is all right. Because I'm a little worried about eating, we have the slender guy, although both of them with my husband are puffy. Then a lot of people come up asking if we are feeding him at all.

@krizdabz I used to be proud of working 14 hours a day and 6 days a week, sleeping little, eating anything at all, not moving at all. One day I found myself being a fat, ugly, tired, sickly, sweaty male. Since then, at least a little has been possible to correct, but willpower was needed!

One at night. Maybe I've already told this, but when I was living with my parents, I was never allowed to eat ice cream with a spoon from the box because it's rude. Now It's all I do — forget about bowls! https://t.co/eLy1vWboBH
@DDzrve Nothing is better than potatoes. You can't stuff yourself so much. I ate three plates, now I'm suffering.

@kasparszellis Is there anyone, except the legendary Grišāns, who has been on a “tour” of the blood, pieces of meat, and boiled prisoner-filled cellars of Rēzeknes čeka? The fact that Antoņina Brasla from Tilža did not go, would be clear. Oh yes - how long and often did those tours happen?
@reallygayTM2 canned peach and a bowl of raspberries for breakfast beans with corn cheese salad wrapped in lavash for lunch leftovers from lunch and half of a chocolate bar for dinner
I visited the cats. They had just finished eating and a conceited owner's cat (with a strap) came over. She got her ass kicked by some unseen one, who just stuffed his head under the fence. The fighting began and the shameless one was chased away. Of course I was on the side of the homeless! No one will take away food from the poor. Wtf! 
@gerda_c I was weeding the beds at one strawberry plantation and also picking strawberries for a few days. I was working with two retired and fun ladies.
I was eating my work lunch quietly today until my boss sat down with me to talk about Russian influence in Latvia. I realized I didn't have an opinion on it at all. Just so much that not knowing the Russian language has always affected my possible job positions.
@krista_japina @gerda_c When the ice cream was melting, did you also lick 1/3 of it quietly and kept selling? 
@ZaneGaisa @KrischaKrisch Okay, okay, I'm not among the supporters of fruitless and vegetableless packages, I just know that there would be more of a fuss about damaged vegetables.

@birzniecepaula Rīslings :) I can't name the specific brand, I don't buy wine in Rimi. You can also see where Cataratto is mentioned - a group of muscat, will give a sweetness. Crudo used to be. You can also be take Gewurztraminer safely, Elzasas not really (it can taste like marinade), others easily.

@KasparsFunts I once raised a hedgehog from the path with great excitement. Epic fail-it bit me strongly!
We agreed that we should start thinking about ourselves physically. Every morning we have to encourage each other. Must call. I'll start to eat breakfast. He'll run. New habits. A challenge. Scared.
@bemusha I was patted on the hand and told to go home to eat and sleep well. I can eat and sleep, but the blood pressure will still be so low that I could faint, but I live with it. Also unfit as a donor.
@reallygayTM2 for breakfast a smoothy, for lunch and dinner an awesome soup (self-cooked). at night simply Kellogg's and musli without milk
@donis777 Yeah.. Why? :) satisfaction from hiking, fishing whatever is one's hobby. But the daily cares and tasks are in the first place and the matters of the heart are as rare as a fatty dessert :( need to change and gain balance.

@VilksTavsBiedrs @DzeneDace Tea increases weight because you need smthn to snack along
@Nodusgordius @phronemophobe No such limit is required in a democratic society. The majority might want to ban the eating of hot dogs because they prefer sausages, but that doesn't mean such a ban is necessary. Latvia is a free country, it should be celebrated, instead of crawling in the direction of RU!

@Sarmite_Kolate A kiosk and the weighted vanilla or chocolate ice cream. In plastic bags. That taste is not restorable. Very. 
@_evija similarly to Haribo bears - first you eat the yellows, then oranges, then reds, whites and greens. and only exclusively two together, there are no other options.
In one word, I think the old age “I don't need anything” has come to me far too early when I just want to sit on the terrace and look at the sunset with a cup of mint tea in my hands. Nowhere to run, nothing to be achieved. Just HAVE everything.

@libarte @Austra Also. I have fried a few times, the result was so pitiful that I'd rather go to the store even in Covid times. Or not eat bread.

In discussions with carnivores the assumption that animals live off of the Sun and air appears rather often. Namely, people often claim something like this - yes, but if we don't eat meat then we'll have to grow more vegetables.
@IvarsNeiders Growing vegetables is more degrading to the planet than livestock farming. This is demonstrated by the tribal transition from livestock to farming. It would be great if people could live off of the Sun and air...
@ZPupola @ms_logina I also don't understand these arguments, especially given that for many the meat substitutes and their similarities to the original help to accept a vegan/plant-based nutrition, to achieve a common goal. Nor do I understand the omnivores who insult vegans for using a substitute product.
@martinsveide @karlis_karlis_ I don't know how delicious the cuisine there is, but the main spice is already used. :) I didn't know about them, but now, when I drive through Kauguri, I will definitely find them and eat there:)
@aaboliiga1 @IvarsNeiders @GMeluskans Where is there any context with boletus? People just can't eat meat and therefore make meat substitutes. That's what @GMeluskans wanted to learn
Christians make fun of Muslims and practising Jews for not eating bacon, but are they all aware that pigs eat everything, literally everything, including people FUCKING EWW
@ZPupola @GMeluskans I think it's hypocrisy either way. In order to grow vegan food, an uncountable number of living creatures are killed. Is it more ethical than killing “directly” for eating? If we don't want to eat meat - we don't eat it, but there's something wrong with ethics there.
@Laurisrenpreis1 We've never consumed as much meat as in the 21st century. The consequences are terrible.
@Bertaane @HienaNeija @bebitsvaig @PunciPunci @Mara_ar_putniem @Agy_1988 @Dzinja @K_Tronenkova @Shakalinda super! Thank you! Cowslip tea is my favorite of medical teas. Very tasty! Pick whole bags and dry it! 
@annabezmiegs I think the discussion between carnivorous and non-carnivorous is usually doomed to failure. And it can go to absurdity on both sides. I agree with the version that man has developed this way due to eating meat, and not the other way around. It has nothing to do with ethics. Everyone has their own belief
@Gulips Unfortunately in Latvia a large proportion of the population consumes meat products produced abroad. Ethics are in place when animal welfare on farms is studied. Chickens in cages, tortured pigs...
@IvarsNeiders @selmuushh @GMeluskans Soy shashlik can be ordered to home from Nata Cafe, pickled in a bucket. It tastes so much like meat that I doubted for a moment if it was not meat.
@apmaldijos if does affect because we regularly ship food in export to both the Middle East and to Africa.. Food will only become more expensive in Europe and America.., which also to the low-income people means a lower-quality diet that is not famine, but also not good.

@Egitazz @KristineGarina @RozeIeva if there can be a belief that you can't eat meat, I may also have the opposite, there must always be meat, AS simple as fuck!
@evka30 @Silkans you should not be reading while eating! it will be a lesson! :)
@atheist_from_lv @Egitazz @RozeIeva Of course, but you don't think that meat should always be eaten BY EVERYONE? So with that, for vegans one food would still be OK if they came to visit? I, of course, don't know what kind of meat non-eating people are in your friend group, but I've never forbidden any meat eater from eating meat. I am the one who doesn't want to eat meat. The others eat it.
@maljorka Not everyone has demanding taste buds & that's fine. At the same time, many believe that making a normal salad means grinding, chopping and dealing with vegetables for half an hour.
@Egitazz Yup, inspired right from chocolate. I like the taste of spicy things a lot.
@LaurisBisenieks @J_Radins The discussion is mainly about industrial husbandry. And most of the meat you can buy has been produced industrially. But a natural meadow can certainly exist without livestock (even biological). And we haven't even started talking about ethics yet.
I rode in heavy rain for the first time this year. Hood, backpack, panting - all you need. I was smarter and I put a vegetable box on my rack so I wouldn't crush my darlings 
the most most most strange way to say that you don't like tomatoes and cucumbers...
@ZPupola @KaarlisKK @Driafre @ArvisKolmanis Ok)) I'm not a vegetarian, but by eating only poultry for a long time, I have come to the point where I can hardly eat any other meat, which makes me think that the organism can be tamed to other changes as well.
@maljorka Salads are overrated.
After Viņķele 
I'm fascinated by people who don't respect other's time, schedule etc. Today I had 10 minutes left to cook and eat lunch! :)
Others: I'm determined to run a marathon, quit smoking, start getting up earlier Me: I won't eat crisps for a week The week has passed and I feel very proud of my accomplishment. :D
Because a fat person doesn't become inadequate after eating another burger. Unlike a drunk who needs more.
@maljorka I abnormally like the taste tomatoes. I adore simply sliced with pepper and salt and balsamic vinegar on top. Fits for breakfast cheese sandwiches, lunch, etc. I can also simply eat tomatoes with great pleasure, without anything else, especially if they are home grown. One of the best things in the world :)
There are days when you put on your dress and get ready before you come to the office at the other end of the apartment, and then arrange a thought-out lunch beautifully on the plate. But then there are days like this - I will not go into the description of clothing, but for lunch I ate just some blend of jar contents from a pot
I've always liked the taste of all the fresh vegetables, even on school excursions I brought fresh paprika with me, for example. A few years ago I was taking a bus to Berlin, vegetables for snacking as always. There was a stranger sitting next to me, loudly being shocked that someone was eating something so horrible. :D
@ArvisKolmanis @ZPupola Even here the narrow-minded, belligerent carnivores kick in :( I get physically sick from meat dishes. Why is it propagated like this?
-Octopuses can use their tentacles to taste and smell food. -Everyone knows that chameleons change color, but they can also move each eye in different directions and look at different places. -the turkey changes the color of its head depending on the mood.

@mazaismurdzins drink either St. John's wort tea or some anxiolytic - you've been continuing to respond to my tweets on several occasions, despite having unfollowed by me.
@Egitazz @RozeIeva @atheist_from_lv Oh well yeah, mayonnaise… It's harder for vegans, but this is probably not with an evil intent. Just didn't think of it. I don't eat many desserts due to gelatin and then there's a long explanation of why. I understand that it's not someone wanting to feed bones to me on purpose. :))

@a_beinarovica cut meat into slices, beat with a meat hammer (if it's chicken, then no need to beat), I soak in soy in sauce, then in flour, then in chopped egg, then oil on the pan - self-cost if meat is purchased on discounts, around 5 Euro / 1kg of chops
@maljorka Hahah, but where's the problem? I sometimes make an omelet, for example, and put cucumber pucks outside in a circle like the Sun. I don't have Instagram, it's just for my own pleasure. But the main thing is to eat those vegetables, irrelevant of the design.
@maljorka I specifically don't like it when everything is mashed together, I like eating things individually. In soups, etc., as well, everything in large pieces in order to feel the individual taste of each ingredient.
Assembly limits are set to 25 people, which makes you think birthdays and all other celebratable days are allowed to be celebrated in a wider circle! Therefore, bigger cakes and more delicious covers are needed… https://t.co/lBzfB3x5Oe

@ArtaLiene Inside it is very good: coffee, a chair, a desk, a computer, big plans and me.
@karlis_arajs I think the vast majority of carnivores eat a series of meat-free dishes as the main dish or sides, but the vast majority of vegitarian, and particularly vegan à la carnivorous food - chops, cheese, eggs-free confectionery where they should be, are unenjoyable.
Chocolates, pickled cucumber, shashlik, marshmallow, pickled cucumber, Coke. Being a woman is very difficult.
@Martins_Ku @raimondssiferis I work out 5-7 times a week at 1-2 h, I eat balanced daily meals, such a fatty dish 2 times per month so that the body has something to struggle with after everyday nutrition. You can skip worrying about me. :)
@LDF_lv @ChiuljuPussala @Spekozols The name “Meat cattle” alone already means that the sensibility of these animals is lowered to a minimum. It's just a temporarily walking block of meat
The biggest risk of not minding the distance will be, of course, at the fried potatoes
@WilmaLinda Sorrel soup was for long a trauma from kindergarten times, but then I reluctantly discovered how it tastes with fresh sorrel picked from our own garden, with meat melting on the tongue, with countryside eggs. But so - the floating islands that seem too sweet to many.

@and_kse The only acceptable form are those big pie-looking dumplings with all sorts of artsy fillings. I can't staaand the little dumplings with that garlicky pig.
@GirtsRagelis @WilmaLinda I like it like this too. One of my childhood's favorite dishes. All the while I was sure it was normal to eat like that, until I began to travel and my Italian, Spanish, even Polish friends blissed their eyes in horror.
@tandemnieks I give canned to the kid. eats a lot and then shoots 
@_sindija_ Must try this. It won't be worse. Yesterday's beetroot soup didn't find its way to the exit...
@latviangrey cottage cheese with sourcream and jam(from childhood),canned peas in addition to nearly all non-sweet dishes. mum can't understand how I like meat (usually meatballs) with potatoes and cottage cheese. the most nonedible of other favorite dishes-tomatoes,any mushrooms,paprika, halva,Cielaviņa
@latviangrey oh I also don't eat vegetable milk soups,fish soups,rye bread, and any other bread made with rye. but I like the film of milk soup. I don't eat tomatoes,don't drink tomato.juice,but I use ketchup and t.sauce often.
@WilmaLinda Cake before meat
@tandemnieks Sour cabbage juice, it may seem brilliantly odious for a child, but you don't need much, just a spoonful. It helped us, but I really don't know how correct it was to give such a juice to a 3-year-old back then, but we had it pretty crazy for a moment, then we tried many things.
@INiedzviedze @WilmaLinda Chocolate kissel with berry kissel as sauce is in this category too? (I like both)
@debes_manna Today at 12 it was still in pajamas, playing during breakfast, drawing, gluing and cutting in the forenoon, and ignoring lunch. I warned that I'd eat and go out for a walk. As I went to get dressed, hysteria began with whining. Got dressed in the end, we rode 5 km by bike. Finally, around 14 had a meal.
@IvarsNeiders @Imazite @lastguru_net What is There not to understand!? In the Soviet times, my mother, a dentist, was always assigned to home visits during the flu epidemic because of a lack of doctors. She had her own method - eating plain garlic. We were also imposed. Neither she got the flu, nor us. Why get a shot? I don't understand 
@phronemophobe No, it's about me not understanding those who say loudly at the table that they don't eat a product X and therefore won't eat, for example, soup. If you're allergic, then ok, if not, screw you. My soup, I cook it how I want it.
@_skabarga I like that every family has their own recipe. Here I see meat, I don't usually cook it with meat.
@tvitermaniaks @phronemophobe Why should I eat the soup that someone has cooked using product x and have to squint around at the table while eating that lame pumpkin or coriander?
@briedisunrepshe I poured water from the kettle not into a cup with a sieve, but in the whole jar of  tea. A completely new jar, 100g...
I bought offal minced meat for my dog and cats for €0.43/kg. “Peremol” (refined in Rus. lang.) is now selling at the same price, I ask what it is? It turns out that it is minced sausages, meat products that will expire in a few days. Animals eat and cheer!
@tvitermaniaks @phronemophobe Then you’re in luck. But others have things that they really don't like very much. So much so, that they want to throw up. For me it's lamprey. If they're available, I try to taste with the idea of “what if I like it this time?” and vomit. It's because of synapses, not beliefs. It shouldn't be taken to heart so much.
I like eating. 
@latviangrey Cielaviņa, corn of any kind, canned tomatoes (excluding tomato sauces and juice).
@WilmaLinda But I like it just like that. Without bread , a meatball+onion and sip sweet tea 
Wow! I stewed chicken/vegetable stew from 10 vegetable varieties. Pretty good! How many vegetables are there in total!? Oh! Dill on top of everything! So 11!!! Am I qualified as a cook yet or not!?
@leitanekristine Yeah, onions are my enemies from childhood, especially fresh ones. Now, around 30 years old, I've learned to eat them in soups, marinades or stews, but also not willingly.
@maardzory I find a lot of stuff from the listed items really tasty and not at all weird. 
OK, this gets second place. 
@ditakrauze I'll repeat for the nth time specifically for you - what I want to say is that I don't think anything seems so untasty for it to make me not eat the dish. That's what I don't understand.
@Silkans Here's a good brand product which is produced at local factories. The same product that is being imported - absolute shit! And at least 2x more expensive! You won't buy good tea or coffee here... they import pre-packed peat! But the brands which produce on the spot, and from the local raw materials here are super!
@Bumbuls2 @IntaK04069245 Don't know. Tomato growers named their business so, and have been working for generations. They probably wanted their countrymen to not be lazy and keep diligently working in the small gardens.
@WilmaLinda In my childhood when there was nothing else more tasty at home - oat flakes+sourcream+sugar+cocoa. But one of the funniest and most unsavory dishes I can imagine is fried cow's colostrum.
In a dream today, I said to someone: “I'm going to Turkey today! Now I can only think about how I'd like staying in Turkey for some 3 months, drinking Turkish tea and living in Istanbul in a little colorful house, as in those Turkish TV shows. How cool to dream like this sometimes:)
today I baked chocolate cookies for the first time, and the most convenient thing to chop chocolate turned out to be a 5 kg dumbbell the cookies turned out very ugly, but they taste very normal
@latviangrey @mvanags We're talking about Soviet time plombir. You're a bit too young... . :) Here you can get a Soviet time ГОСТ made one, and you can say what you want - it tastes excellent and as ice cream should, not soy shit filled with essences!
@didzisdadzis @didzvein ok, well at least chocolate is marked as per the Latvian cultural canon. it softens the conditions. you can start living in the Liepna and eating plombir Pols. While in the rest of Latvia everyone eats the classic Pols.
@WilmaLinda Potato pancakes covered with a mixture of sugar+cinnamon.
@iLOVEciepa xl dumplings
@tvitermaniaks For a long time I couldn't understand why I can't eat coriander, it's healthy however, and half of the world is fainting over it, until I learned it was genetic - the taste receptors for some people perceive it as unsavory.
@MercenaryJohnD @pulks @jzigajev @Brivibas36 @krisjaniskarins @Vinkele @veselibasmin @SPKCentrs @Nords @SandisRiekstins I diligently wash my hands, don't shake hands with people, sleep well, eat 4x a day, don't smoke, do physical activities and am glad that children can also do sports, and coaches can continue to educate them. That is very important. Most importantly, safe and sa
@MatissJekabsons @dj_beatmaster I also am very fond of fast food. Burgers, and pizzas, fries with sauces and bacon... Abnormally. Bulimia manifested itself in the form of fast food + sports and diarrhea medicine.
@VilksTavsBiedrs Variety dogs are overall sensitive to everything. Over six years I have gotten used to feeding specifically. And sometimes give a drink of beer, because all the boys like it.
This well went down the pipe. To those who like mango - I recommend it! https://t.co/nBV2LP4Xsl
@skatsnokoka @Vents_Zvaigzne @juriskazha @SigmaLS8361 @frakcija @IMurniece There is just a bag of rags there... That's why colleagues from Leta avoided having lunch with him.
Since I don't have a food picture because everything was eaten at a huge speed, I will have to glorify on Twitter: @EzerietisJ has a talent for cooking! I have, of course, for eating 
Dank from hopalaabrewery 
@GunitaBa @krizdabz Yup, then when you have a jubilee, your friends come to eat cake 
I think I am beginning to understand how does the kitchen & cooking work. Tonight I fried chicken with onions and paprika and milk in sauce. I added the paprika too late, but otherwise very nice. Māris, 32 years old.
I think I am beginning to understand how does the kitchen & cooking work. Tonight I fried chicken with onions and paprika and milk in sauce. I added the paprika too late, and I totally forgot to cut in a tomato, but otherwise very nice. Māris, 32 years old.
I am eating kebab box, how about you?
Those who don't like me can go to eat amanitas
@WilmaLinda Kārums cheese dessert sliced on rye bread (this one doesn't seem strange to me anyway). I also sometimes buy a big piece of dorblue cheese and eat it like an apple, in such big bites, right there in the car at the wheel. The taste buds are happiest after such a “bite”.
@_skabarga A dog is perfect until it rolls over in some crap, then eats it and later throws up on your expensive carpet.
@cepuminji No matter how sad it is, my sister pours a tea mushroom drink in those bottles. 
@and_kse It makes me feel that these show up like mushrooms after rain. Because today, out of context, even Vakcīnrealitāte instead of trying to shit on me is shooting left and right. https://t.co/oYotuIR6fx
@liana_langa НТВ “Международная пилорама” Humor show. The liberators can't eat in a restaurant because there is no Russian on the menu among the six languages. And that is in a NATO country.
@loyds25 I could afford something when I achieved something, and so I lived on. But now everything is the other way around. The future is for those who are prepared to eat dirt. Those who expect everything to fall into their hands will also stay like that at the bar with a bottle in their hands.
The 246th day - there are still no tomatoes... https://t.co/iRTrBzywQ3
@ViktorijaS In our home the situation with eating stereotypes is truly weak, everyone eats how they like. Respectfully, the child too, well, I only don't allow to drink soap water...much 
raise your hand if you also drink tea without sugar
@LiepinLiva @annabindere Then why should you spoil buckwheat if you don't want to feel the taste of it? I like buckwheat pancakes with buckwheat taste. In the past I also used to bake oatmeal-salted pancakes, actually, I've been thinking about them again for some time, maybe I'll get to myself together and bake some. For those, oat flakes, must be soaked in broth from the evening, can be in vegetable broth.
@Florianmustdie tea and coffee without sugar ftw but you can always have something sugary on the side
@ancetarvida @my_rita Oh yes! In university years, I was not too lazy to go to the AB dam for my lunch break and devour a sandwich with a view of Old Riga!
@latviangrey Bull's eye or boiled egg yolk, beetroot salad (excluding those made at home), lard, herring in oil, cartilage, liquorice, caramel and vanilla (with rare exceptions).
cold coffee may be a bit disgusting, but occasionally I drink some like that. and it is ok, caffeine does its part.
What new ice cream would you make? — With an earthy taste. woop. https://t.co/hnEcY8GfRO
In the COVID times Ķirson's bistro figured that they wouldn't be offering to warm up food anymore, that's why I am now eating a cold pilaf at work, because I wanted specifically pilaf.
@elinakursite Did you really eat all of it?
@tandemnieks If it eats little, then there's really nothing more to be had. I mean, if there is really, really nothing “unhealthy” to eat at home, are they going to starve and eat nothing? Did they at least eat the cold soup? Isn't there something reasonably healthy, non-hardening for the stomach that they like, that can be fed at any time? :)
@sursurs They really like cold soup because it's pink, girls color. Usually they eat almost the whole small dish. There are few things that they like. Meatball soup with lentils and broccoli. Cooked meat. Now brushing in sliced fresh cabbage. I'll add that they hardly eat candy, it's not an appetite thief.
50 minutes of glory! Today I got on the TV 😲 visiting @robertomeloni on the channel @24tv. We were baking thin pancakes with fresh apple jam, making arugula and strawberry salad, talking about food, triathlon, and family. Thanks for hosting, it was great! #ladolcevita https://t.co/EBuDRo7kQv
@atheist_from_lv @jenuufa Don't hunting dogs taste the prey?
@sursurs Here we could drink for liters. Juices, of course. I dilute 1:1 with water. So the indifference to sweets has simply shifted towards the direction of drinking. Which isn't bad while being sick. Whatever the trouble, drink and drink a lot. You need to think about it, yes, because they will always eat plain rice.
This is a montage! I eat a lot of watermelons and I've never had anything like that inside. Why would you fool people with such fake videos?! https://t.co/8TA4Wq2GHg
I'm looking forward to Sunday, when it will get warmer, and finally I can spread it all over the two balconies, put up normal support for tomatoes/pepper, replant herbs, plant lettuce and other details. I'm SO tired of carrying everything in/out! I'm getting a little grumpy. #balkondārziņš https://t.co/pxX4fP0ok9
@didzvein Exactly. This is a total “let them eat cakes!” variant.
@DvinuMamma I told the gentleman to collect everything quickly and I ate only what was packed. 😁
@MatissJekabsons @Egitazz @B_Inga I can't not eat, then I start to get a total powerless feeling and depression. I rather eat and burn it off while I doing sports. Then I become alert, energetic, confident about myself... If only I could keep myself eating.
why did I start eating vegan https://t.co/4SQjyTc7aK
Just watched Nicole Kidman eat worms. She did it in a beautiful dress and very classy. https://t.co/OSN0RxW2F9
@ZiemasEzis @sarkanakmens yes, some eat bats, while others wear masks (but only on public transport). That's how it is and that's it, not much to wonder about, but you decide to be with them or against
TW// nora eat my ass! my neat brown bear! 
tasting schnapps which has 80% is quite okay, dad calls it fire water
if Latvia needs anything, then it must be chips with the taste of “tomato and cucumber salad sour cream”
@AValdbergs @kasparsskincs @TInzenieris Kidney executioner!:) I'm all for classic values in this food niche(😂)-beer (reallly like Tērvete's light:)),wine(favorite),whiskey,vodka,gin.
@ancetarvida Oh, too many such cases, especially working in a bar. Customers have complained about music (not about the volume, but they don't like what is being played) that the soup is too hot, often eat the food completely and then say it wasn't good, and refuse to pay.
my mom noticed that I liked avocados. I now have 16 avocados at home.
@ofija_ Worked. Tastes good. I made one for the first time and with white wine. Still proud as a peacock 😂
@riigasiedzimtaa The same shit. I hate eating Ibumetin (50% of which in I just vomit). That's why I always delay eating pills, hoping it will be overrr... ️😂‍♀️
Several large families in Līvāni receive a gift – tomato plants In more detail: https://t.co/VqpHavMuBH https://t.co/Elll1y5ySY
I will never eat Mexican tacos again.
We had a taste of Allažu ķimelis for the first time. I must say how it is, I don't love liqueurs much, but this one is good. https://t.co/bQs0Ks90bU
Somehow interesting. The hospitality sector is one of the few where envelope wages are the most prominent. Now they want to cut VAT. Then is construction also within the candidates? When they reduced VAT on vegetables and fruit specific to Latvia, they became more expensive for the end consumer. Is this experience is not enough?
@Laumaryn @_skabarga When I lived alone I never had anything at home either, except oat flakes, salt, sugar, and tea and I'm a “cook”. All correct. :D
In the past, grandma used to bring sweets and symbolic gifts to me and my cousins for Christmas. One year Liene got long white wedding gloves (and she married a couple of years later), and I — a grater. Thank you, grandma.
@DzeneDace I treated myself with Italian chocolate ice cream so that nerves are calmer during the pandemic :)
A day when there are too many additional things to process for the brain. I find out that my girlfriend is getting a 3rd baby, of course, joy and at least something positive. Afterwards, that some acquaintance was lost to cancer. And finally, my son's adventures in finding “new flavors” by eating a ball.
@_skabarga @naurisk_ @Laumaryn I remember that mussel stuff, yes, it really might not be (in my opinion) in non-recipe, but this, come on, is as basic as it :D maybe the difference is really in lifestyle/stage :) when I lived alone/was younger, my non-recipe was wolt-types, wine in the fridge, and tomato sauce
@Laumaryn @naurisk_ I also tend to remember things and link them to today. Because mussels and canned tomato soup are so related.
@Elina_EK @_skabarga @elina_shh Along with soy and other plant types of milk, I thought the most akin to regular milk in terms of the taste is hemp milk. I don't really drink milk - with coffee, porridges. But I like soy milk the most. :)
@AnnijaGreka @elinakursite @Meibija @DagnijaNeimane I eat humble cutouts. Rarely anyone of these post-soviet catering defenders has ever cooked them even once!
@Antuanete @chirkainaisLV @elinakursite I agree, Americans have a special relationship with meat. Which also kind of answers the question “where the & ^ #% $ did all the bison go?” without disappoint ;) ;)
@Vinotava @Meibija @DagnijaNeimane @elinakursite A pile of fresh vegetables means that the vegetables have not been buried with sourcream which is so dear for Latvians, and a person can choose for themselves how much/or if vinegar, olive oil, salad sauce, etc.
@Snowtales @Krista_Baumane @and_kse @io7246 @Meibija @elinakursite @DagnijaNeimane Unfortunately the post-soviet eating culture has lasted. Sausage in olivier salad, sausage in solyanka, cheese on chicken chop.... Throw on any plate, throw some vegetables in addition... Besides, it's not a lonely diner on the roadside, but one where “everybody likes it” and must be shared on IG.

We will end the tour in the museum area. Here you can rest your legs, eat, and look at the history of the development of the city of Valmiera at the Hanza buildings. By the way, in 1782 there were only 310 inhabitants and 1 street in Valmiera. In 1881 there were 18 streets and 2410 inhabitants. 19/n https://t.co/lQdvAdRSU3
@spigana Strong coffee helps me a bit...
@cepum_s If you don't eat 4 asparagus put in a cross and don't call a chef in excitement, you don't know how to live 🤣 and if you fly with Airbaltic YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT QUALITY!!!! By the way, @Vinotava , asparagus is a bigger piece of filth than lettuce from Kūriņš stained by a warm sauce. #trololololoooo
@aaboliiga1 before write you off, try buying it and making at home in marinade from things you like
reasons, why not to be with me 3; 8. I didn't wear pants at all( house pants don't count) 14. I can't draw 15. My favorite animals are pigs cows and bears 16. I don't like smoking,drinking 17. I eat plain rice for lunch at school 18. I'd like to have 3 kids
@and_kse @EsEsmuTuEsmuEs Wait, do I correctly understand that what matters to her is how the food looks and how fancy it is, not how much a medic gets to eat from it? IMO you can't eat from those fancy, pardon me, poops in a paper...
@RozeIeva @Krista_Baumane @IngmarsLadigs A cook is there to understand what to cut and what not to cut, what size mushrooms to put in a sauce, and what in soup. To pour sauce on top or on the side. What size and shape of plate is suitable.
@krizdabz @aigarius You know what would be cool? When something turned off and suddenly didn't charge that time, then you could get notified about it through the phone application... or sms, for example, when the charging device itself realized it was no longer charging. So that It's not like you are having lunch somewhere, and in the end find out that it didn't charge...
@agnijagrigule I had a rather palpable aftertaste from that tap water at home, at one point I had that there filter kettle or a whatdoyoucallit, it helped, but got broken, was buying bottles again. I am now drinking tap water in England, although my flat mates were horrified that I tastes earthy, I don't feel any such thing 😂 😂

@ArtursL @EsEsmuTuEsmuEs It must become generic term, circa “Rollton a la Lonton”! In the future, I'll always disguise all my kitchen failures and turn them into an effect. “No, it's not a hot potato mess, it's a stew in Lonton's taste”! Did you hear @Mara_ar_putniem ?
Hello, @Sadalestikls ! If it is not a secret, why did electricity go out in Dobele county today? We were in the diner, but we didn't have time to eat.
@_liiga Probably because it tastes like rubber
@cepum_s I am eating a remnant of Soviet gastronomy for the second day - solyanka-type soup! Have to go warm up some more :D
@valerijssturis @mkKilups There are various mushrooms described in the links on Delfi. See this picture https://t.co/uCeNlCmOBR
@HienaNeija @Vinotava @Meibija @Egitazz @elinakursite @DagnijaNeimane Well here are really fancy experts. Darnit, it's a meal to keep someone from kicking the bucket. And if it you even like how it tastes then what else? You can't see the ground anymore from high shelves.
@debes_manna I'm holding on, diligently holding on. At the moment I'm cooking and looking at the cooking lessons. I am skipping very well and not listening to that nonsense at all. But still. Exhausting.
✾ mix: cottage cheese ~200+g oil ≤100ml milk ≤100ml ✾ add sugar, salt +other spices/additives as needed ✾ add flour in parts ~400g & baking powder ✾ knead the dough, cool in the refrigerator for half an hour, ✾ roll out the dough, bake the flatbread, buns, etc. ~180°
@lambruscoweet I don't eat chops. :)
- Your first four men got poisoned by mushrooms, but the fifth fell down the stairs. How will you explain it? - The fifth one did not like mushrooms
@elinakursite Traditionally this is eaten alone
@Beibleids @maris_74 Need to look at how much electricity it consumes, but I've eaten smoked salmon there, etc., brilliant
@koshi_peleeks @maljorka @mairitaluse Yes!! For mine the muffin pans are also going strong! Sometimes even at the table they want to put everything in there and only eat like that 😅
@IevaSt @elinakursite @janksb @Meibija @DagnijaNeimane Quality food and tapes are two unrelated things. They thrive, and actually exactly at the expense of low-quality food.
@io7246 @Vinotava @Meibija @elinakursite @DagnijaNeimane It's about being exaggerated. You don't even need to be a snob to realise that there's so much brutally thrown in the bowl that would be difficult to eat for even 2 people
@IevaSt @elinakursite @janksb @Meibija @DagnijaNeimane In what people eat in public catering, processed products (“processed food”) there are so many poor quality and questionable ingredients which at home are deemed to be garbage or even not a clue what the composition of it is.
is tea overdose a real thing?
@GaumigsJoks @E_Stendzenieks @TautasLaiks That's said to be normal. Drug addicts are slowly losing the meaning of life. It usually happens. You see, now they're going around animal farms, eating groundhogs in one, ostriches in the other, will be eating fish or strawberries tomorrow. :) (an infant is making a roll of advertising for a drooping small town)
@UgisB Carnivores also need to eat
I awfully like the taste of cookie dough.
today, with the wife of the Baptist Pastor, I was eating borscht and badmouthed Mārcis Jencītis. the guy announced in a sermon that there is only one Perfect Man in the congregation and that is himself :D in addition there needs to be the same number of men and women in the congregation, because that is the Will of God
Who would have thought - it turns out, not everyone likes their own medicine...
@DvinuMamma @KristZii Also olivier salad - if sliced finely, the flavors tighten much better. I can't bear those big bites of potatoes and carrots. On the other hand, when it comes to lettuce etc. fresh vegetable salads - I completely agree.
Everything would be good if the State had supported the economy instead of borrowing money to eat it down. We'll eat the money by the New Year and then we'll be surprised ;)
Looking at snacking Zane's Instagram when you can't eat dairy products is excruciating.
@oskarsvizbulis @VLejniece After growing up, it lived in an enclosure in the garden; jumped over the fence to the neighbors and ate their strawberries...
https://t.co/8wt759FzmV rly?v=yl4V7ZrTPUUU Pēteris Kļava at his level. You can agreed with some things, and not with some other things, but it's something to think about when drinking tea.
@Zuzzzeee You don't even need to boil the dumplings? :D Apologies for the nitpicking.
CLICK ❤ IF YOU LIKE THE TASTE , HOW MANY LIKES CAN WE GET FOR THIS POST? https://t.co/OOJ1l5nJmP
@IslandeMamma @nenormamma Make potato buns with onion for them 🤣
@IslandeMamma Sounds extreme but tastes really good. I recommend.
@IslandeMamma To be fully honest, my spring salad since childhood has been torn plain leaf lettuce, cucumber, radish, chives, and sourcream. You can add a little horseradish. There. New potatoes with dill and a slice of chop and you know my childhood's greatest happiness ;) and a bit too much salt!
@ievagai @Anete_etenA By the way, we call mayonnaise with ketchup (50/50) kokteilsósa, and is sold in any store. Great with fries and hamburgers.
@h_punkts Are we having lunch together ?😁🙈 And yes, that cake is just so FANTASTIC, but since the name of my colleague is Inese, I got it for congratulating her 😁 Well then bon appetit to you every time we had lunch together 🤝🏻😁 To that freedom, yeeea no, not yet 😁
Dear table cultural apologists, teach me to behave! If I get a beer as the beverage with a main dish, but I haven't finished it and keep it on the table until dessert, where cake and coffee is served, then how do I handle these two drinks?
@v5_c4 Depends on the day. But often really at the same time. About the cake - I believe it! I like these too. Well then bon appetit to you too! 🙂
In short, I've discovered a new keto America. Fried radishes taste almost like fried potatoes. I almost want to say they're more delicious. https://t.co/RMh6Co8ymj
@elinakursite I thought that not fennel.. but the tastes get mixed up there and it's really good :) you will come to eat at my place sometime 😉
@Liene86806915 @UgisB But I saw barely born or even yet unhatched crow corpses falling from a tree. Nothing, somehow I am hanging on and keep on living and haven't stopped eating chicken eggs.
@_skabarga Very, very tasty 👍
The Wolf looked into the basket and realized he was going to eat Red Riding Hoods, apologies - Miss Goldblum's! fried sorrel pie for dinner. It's a shame there's no kefir at home...
@tofikblogs @tvitermaniaks celiac disease from birth, pollen allergy, and furthermore, if I am stressed, I can start having an allergic reaction from any food product. one time I almost kicked the bucket due to almonds, now I can eat them again 💁‍♀️
@Vents_Zvaigzne How does asparagus taste?
@elina_shh I wasn't in Lisbon, but I was in both Faro and Porto, and Doro Valley. Portugal is the place to go. I was there for 2.5 weeks and enjoyed it very much. People are kind, the food is delicious and vinho verde is refreshing.
I have said three (3) swear words throughout my lifetime haha pls don't judge me by 😆👍
@SievieteR All salesmen wanted to pack everything neatly. My husband mistook the salad in the dish for the cake in the morning. 😂😂😂
I've been sleeping at lunchtime every working day since March. Both the job capabilities are improving, and the mood. Maybe I need to move to Spain? I'll have siestas, I'll be able to keep sleeping for lunchtime even in not a state of emergency. 😄
I was gifted strawberries that smell and taste like strawberries. Mmmmmmm...
@Vents_Zvaigzne @JanaSima @kulervo @liana_langa @Ruta_Mezavilka where is the absurd? Food should be given in a restaurant, not screwing people over about their beliefs. Then in another restaurant the owner of this restaurant can also not be served food for his outings?
darida is a smply king shit, not only top mineral water, but also cream soda and ice tea and everything cheap af. Plus mf design!! https://t.co/OPe4aS5kV1
@klavs_asmanis mmmm... no, somehow no. in my hands they wouldn't get to be placed on bread. I eat everything with bread, but these I folded down right beside the stove, without bread, so to say - without leaving the cash register. then later I just had to drink a beer.
@Farming_Bear @_angelicmou Omg I need that short and pants
